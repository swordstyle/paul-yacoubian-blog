[00:00] So in the enterprise
[00:02] how many different workflows are there
[00:04] like thousands tens of thousands of
[00:06] different things right and especially in
[00:08] marketing you cannot reduce marketing to
[00:10] one thing right you can't replace a
[00:13] marketer with one workflow you can't
[00:15] that's just not how it works marketing
[00:17] marketing is it requires all of your
[00:20] brain it is it touches every aspect of a
[00:23] business right these are really critical
[00:26] functions so we I do not recommend
[00:29] trying to automate
[00:30] marketers out of their roles. I think
[00:33] you have to give them these kind of high
[00:35] leverage systems to go drive the work
[00:38] that they do through the organization. I
[00:40] think that's a different way to frame it
[00:42] for a lot of teams.
[00:49] >> Hi, I'm Greg Stewart, CEO of MMA Global,
[00:52] the International Nonprofit Trade
[00:53] Association for CMOs who are focused on
[00:55] architecting a new future of marketing.
[00:58] I'm Rex Briggs, an author, market
[01:00] researcher, measurement inventor, and
[01:02] entrepreneur. I'm Greg Stewart, CEO of
[01:04] MMA Global. I'm Rex Briggs, an author,
[01:07] marketing researcher, and entrepreneur,
[01:08] and this is Decoding AI for Marketing.
[01:12] Hey, Rex, what do you uh what what AI?
[01:14] We haven't talked about this at all.
[01:15] What AI tools are you most into right
[01:18] now? Is there anything that you're
[01:19] really obsessed with?
[01:22] >> Yeah, I mean, you know, the the tool the
[01:24] tooling is a big issue. Um I still like
[01:27] to build my own custom or have my team
[01:29] building our own custom tool sets. Uh
[01:32] but things like notebook LM of course
[01:34] were were you know just an amazing thing
[01:35] where you can give it a bunch of
[01:36] context. We gave it 16 different uh
[01:39] strategic planning documents that
[01:40] different leaders in the company had uh
[01:42] worked on at Claratoss and we had it
[01:44] generate a 45minute podcast plus some of
[01:46] the white papers and and some of the
[01:48] other industry directions so that
[01:50] everyone in the company could hear where
[01:51] we thought things were going. That was a
[01:53] really cool nice workflow and tool, but
[01:55] the key to it was of course having the
[01:57] context of what we as a company believed
[02:00] and were focused on as well some of the
[02:02] key white papers. So, you know, I I'm
[02:04] looking at tools that are doing a lot
[02:05] more with context, which is I think
[02:08] where today's guest comes in.
[02:10] >> Yeah. Yeah. Listen, I think there's a
[02:12] you know, listen, a lot of us are uh in
[02:13] fact, I don't Rex, you haven't even seen
[02:15] we just finished some research with
[02:16] Canar trying to understand consumer
[02:19] adoption of the main ai chatbots. you
[02:22] know whether it be open AI or or uh you
[02:24] know Daria everybody you know one accla
[02:26] everything else is out there and so we
[02:28] have some sense there's a massive but at
[02:30] the end of the day if you use those
[02:30] tools you start to go yeah I mean this
[02:33] doesn't really fill in all the gaps for
[02:34] me and I can't really share stuff unless
[02:36] I tell somebody else about it so that
[02:38] doesn't really kind of work so I think
[02:40] there's a big opportunity as we're going
[02:42] to see today from today's guest around
[02:44] is there a layer that sits above those
[02:47] LLMs or independent however you would do
[02:49] that we'll let uh him tell us that uh
[02:51] that can really help enterprises work
[02:53] together to better understand sort of
[02:55] how they really get things done and that
[02:57] are organized in a way that they sort of
[02:59] do stuff, right?
[03:01] >> Yeah. Yeah, that's right. And and this
[03:02] is really an important issue. I think
[03:04] the whole idea of context management or
[03:06] content management system for AI, how
[03:09] that works is really going to be
[03:10] important for companies. And today we
[03:13] have Paul Yakobian joining us. He's CEO
[03:16] of copy uh.ai, AI, which by my
[03:19] understanding is a lot more than just
[03:21] generating copy. It helps us really
[03:23] solve some of those go to market pain
[03:25] points and brings contacts together and
[03:27] helps you manage that in in a in a
[03:29] fairly efficient way. So, welcome Paul.
[03:32] >> Thanks for having me, Rex. Greg, it's
[03:33] good to be here.
[03:34] >> Yeah, good. Good.
[03:37] >> Yeah, that's fine. Yep.
[03:38] >> Okay, good. So, yeah,
[03:42] always risk. Hey, hey Paul, why don't
[03:44] you give just a little why don't you
[03:45] just in your own words give background
[03:46] to the listener for what copy.ai is all
[03:48] about.
[03:49] >> Sure. So we started the company in 2020
[03:51] using the GPT3 models and at that time
[03:54] they were good for generating short form
[03:56] text and so we applied that to marketing
[03:58] and sales content generation use cases
[04:01] and at that time that was really the
[04:03] first application to ever be able to
[04:05] generate net new uh content and copy for
[04:08] customers. And so we scaled that
[04:10] business up and then 2023, middle of
[04:12] 2023, we got the GPT4 models and that
[04:15] really enabled enterprisegrade
[04:17] automation. So you could then trust the
[04:19] models to follow the instructions to
[04:21] take in a lot of context and that really
[04:23] started to help these large enterprise
[04:25] companies solve for that that context
[04:27] management problem. And so from there
[04:29] we've moved the business up market. we
[04:32] are now working with like Fortune 100
[04:34] companies and helping them scale those
[04:38] kind of best best practice um customer
[04:40] experiences across you know millions of
[04:42] of their own customers and so it has
[04:45] been a wild ride and then in the process
[04:48] of this you know you've got chat GPT
[04:50] coming out you've got every company
[04:52] turning around and saying well what
[04:54] what's our AI game plan here and a big
[04:56] part of the ROI equation for companies
[04:59] is actually mastering that context
[05:01] context management. We talk a lot about
[05:03] customer context management which means
[05:05] it's the customer getting a unified
[05:08] experience end to end across both the
[05:10] marketing and the sales journey. And
[05:12] when they tell us and they give us
[05:13] information are we taking that into
[05:15] account when we go and message them
[05:16] whether that's automated messaging or
[05:18] through our own sales organization going
[05:20] and messaging customers. And so every uh
[05:23] you know every exact every SMO we talk
[05:25] to they that's what they care about.
[05:27] They want it to be on brand. and they
[05:28] want it to be positioned consistently
[05:30] throughout that experience because
[05:32] that's where the leverage comes from
[05:33] with the messages. And so it's been a,
[05:36] you know, both a wild ride, very fun and
[05:38] exciting.
[05:40] >> Learn a lot along the way and and I
[05:42] think to a large extent everybody's
[05:43] figuring this out at the same time. So
[05:45] there are really no experts in these
[05:47] fields.
[05:48] >> Yeah. Well, politicians, I mean, just
[05:49] for the listener that don't know, I
[05:50] mean, I I looked in LinkedIn. It at
[05:51] least says you're d you've doubled the
[05:53] size of your employee account in the
[05:54] last two years. So you guys are on a
[05:56] tear right now. That's right. You took
[05:57] in money from Sequoia and a few other
[05:59] venture capitalists. So, yes, I mean,
[06:00] you know, listen, Paul, sounds like
[06:01] you're in the you're in the heat of the
[06:02] battle.
[06:04] >> It's fun. Yeah, it's in the We're in the
[06:06] arena. Yeah. But we're here on behalf of
[06:08] customers, right? They're they're
[06:09] looking to us to help them through this
[06:11] process. And I think when we were when
[06:13] we first started the company, we had to
[06:15] do a little bit of preaching about like
[06:17] the AI transformation. And now we don't
[06:20] have to sell people on that at all. It
[06:22] is just a question of okay we see this
[06:25] future state where it's you know super
[06:27] you know intelligent highly automated
[06:30] you have feedback loops all over the
[06:31] place but today I've got my our existing
[06:35] you know technology investments or
[06:36] existing headcount our existing existing
[06:38] agency spend and we have a massive like
[06:42] gap between where we are today and where
[06:45] that future state is and mo nobody
[06:47] really understands how they're going to
[06:49] go get there and so what what we kind of
[06:51] view our job is to help kind of guide
[06:53] people along that way. Say, hey, don't
[06:55] don't bite off too much. Don't try to
[06:56] overdo it on a lot of these use cases.
[06:58] Don't over complicate things. Let's
[07:00] let's start and really get that those
[07:02] data foundations. That's really key. So,
[07:04] like what are we trying to actually go
[07:05] do? And then where can we get the most
[07:08] leverage in the actual workflow itself?
[07:11] And that that's a big question I think a
[07:14] lot of a lot of people have when they
[07:15] come to us. We're like, hey, we don't
[07:17] know where to start. Where do we start?
[07:18] Do I just give, you know, chat licenses
[07:21] out to everybody? Is that enough? Does
[07:23] that actually solve the efficiency gap
[07:25] problem that we're talking about? And uh
[07:28] you know I was talking to a friend of
[07:30] mine over the weekend and he's like well
[07:32] you know we have all this like AI stuff
[07:34] like obviously productivity is
[07:36] skyrocketing. I looked up Q1 non-farm
[07:41] business productivity growth.
[07:44] It was minus 1.5% in the US.
[07:47] >> So somehow America's gone down. Yeah.
[07:52] Uh oh.
[07:53] >> Yeah. Well, and you saw
[07:56] Whoops.
[07:56] >> I don't know if you saw the paper that
[07:57] just came out uh on the coders, but they
[08:01] took 16 coders that were well
[08:03] well-versed in a code base, an open
[08:05] source codebase. They had five years of
[08:07] experience. Their estimate was that it
[08:09] would that AI using you know cursor on
[08:12] claude 3.5 and 3.7 would increase their
[08:15] productivity you know 20 to 30% and the
[08:17] productivity actually went down by 19%.
[08:20] And it was uh I mean it's a small sample
[08:23] and you know we're now on cloud 4.0 know
[08:25] so each each week you know you get
[08:27] something more and more advanced but I
[08:30] think that it uh a lot of them were
[08:32] surprised that their productivity went
[08:34] down as they looked at they're like ah
[08:36] yeah well I guess you're waiting for the
[08:37] prompt to come back then you got to fix
[08:38] the code and if you already know the
[08:40] code really well it doesn't necessarily
[08:42] make you faster yet but the belief is
[08:44] that that will happen some point in the
[08:46] future what's your thought about that uh
[08:48] that research is it sounds like that's
[08:50] sort of what you're seeing here a little
[08:52] bit and what's the anecdote for it
[08:54] >> yeah why is that really happening, Paul?
[08:55] Do you think that's the state that we
[08:57] are right now?
[08:58] >> Uh, it's possible if you have if you
[09:00] have pretty senior engineers, they have
[09:02] workflows that make them very
[09:04] hyperproductive and sometimes that the
[09:06] coding, you know, the AI coding workflow
[09:10] helps maybe more amateur novice
[09:13] programmers get up to speed faster. So,
[09:15] you see more of that productivity gain.
[09:17] My guess would be junior level people
[09:20] getting a lot accomplished. Um, but that
[09:23] that's a you know it's a great it's a
[09:25] great great paper. I think it's worth
[09:27] having that not just conversation but
[09:29] really more studies around this. I think
[09:30] that's gonna be pretty key. And I when I
[09:33] look at the to aggregate productivity
[09:35] stats I'm like there's you know we have
[09:38] we have a lot of work to do. There was
[09:40] another great study by theory ventures
[09:42] in the startup world looking at
[09:45] companies that had adopted kind of
[09:47] enduser AI chat tools versus ones that
[09:50] took a platform approach either built
[09:52] their own internal system or invested in
[09:56] a you know platform system like ours.
[09:58] They saw really no no growth net no net
[10:02] revenue growth impact from just AI chat
[10:05] tools and they saw 19% growth for
[10:08] companies that took a systemic approach
[10:10] to to rethinking how their organization
[10:12] structured and I think that's that's
[10:14] pretty much what you would expect. I
[10:17] think in a lot of the workflows that the
[10:19] enterprises care about they are kind of
[10:22] because the workflow is so manual and
[10:24] broken today they paper over it with
[10:26] people. They just throw bodies at the
[10:28] problem. Uh most of those are just like
[10:29] third party agency bodies at the
[10:31] problem. They don't really solve the
[10:33] problem. And I think those are the spots
[10:35] where we like like to come in and really
[10:38] accelerate what the customer is able to
[10:40] do. Those have very clear ROIs and it's
[10:43] on it's baked into that use case. So,
[10:46] let's let's get really specific on that
[10:47] because I think it'll really help the
[10:48] listener unpack what you see as a a
[10:53] problem or the key problem and how uh
[10:57] how you go about solving it uh with more
[10:59] of the platform approach. And if you
[11:01] want to use specific anecdotes or
[11:03] specific customers, great. I mean, I
[11:04] think the more tangible you make it uh
[11:06] you know, I think they'll be the better
[11:08] for the listener.
[11:09] >> Yeah. So we'll start with a little
[11:11] systems engineering work, but most
[11:14] process engineering has steps in it that
[11:18] have task time associated with it. And
[11:21] what AI chat bots do really well is they
[11:24] help you accelerate the time it takes to
[11:26] do the task. So, if you know something
[11:29] comes onto your desk for review and it
[11:31] used to take you five minutes to flip
[11:33] through the dock, mark it up and move it
[11:36] on, that might now take you 90 seconds.
[11:40] Great. So, that's two and a half minutes
[11:42] of time savings. But the process from
[11:45] the person that sent it to you to get it
[11:48] all the way back to them might take a
[11:49] week, might have a 7-day turnaround time
[11:52] on that. So, when you're looking at the
[11:54] entire process, you did not speed it up.
[11:57] even though you use a chatbot, right?
[11:59] So, what you actually want to do is
[12:00] remove that step al together, codify
[12:04] that review step as a as an LLM
[12:07] workflow. That's something that we do.
[12:09] And then put that right back to the
[12:11] person that created it so that they can
[12:14] run it themselves. That that takes that
[12:16] week out of the process.
[12:18] >> So, the b the battle is not task time,
[12:20] it's weight time. And that's what makes
[12:22] large companies slow because they have
[12:24] the most number of those review steps.
[12:27] And so what's really interesting when
[12:29] you look at you have to use project
[12:31] management software, right?
[12:33] >> You're just mapping out how slow your
[12:36] company is. Okay?
[12:38] >> Yeah,
[12:39] >> that's what we're mapping out. So take
[12:41] every single process that's flittering
[12:43] between different people in the
[12:45] organization and automate just that one
[12:47] part of it. you will you will find the
[12:50] maximum amount of time savings there and
[12:52] where where you end up especially for
[12:54] marketers is it is a time tomarket
[12:57] battle how fast can I go get to market
[13:00] so when you look at large companies
[13:02] Microsoft's a great example we're
[13:04] helping them with translation in their
[13:06] Japanese market so it's the hardest
[13:08] language to translate
[13:10] they are delaying product launches
[13:13] because their third party agencies can't
[13:15] complete the work fast enough so They're
[13:18] not getting products to market because
[13:20] >> yeah, that's a huge cost to them. I
[13:22] mean, that's days and days of revenue,
[13:23] lifetime value. Yeah, that's a great
[13:25] point.
[13:25] >> And then their translators are doing
[13:28] verbatim translation. So, it shows up.
[13:30] It's like broken English in the other
[13:32] language.
[13:33] >> Yeah.
[13:33] >> Right. And then the the local teams are
[13:35] like, I can't even I don't even feel
[13:38] confident like I feel terrible launching
[13:40] with this kind of content. So, you see
[13:42] this in the in a global context. they've
[13:45] got, you know, 40 plus languages that
[13:47] they operate in. That bottleneck can be
[13:50] months in terms of how long does it take
[13:51] to prep all of that work. Um, so you
[13:54] start to just like rattle off the
[13:56] benefits and the ROI is not really the
[13:58] issue. The issue becomes, okay, they
[14:00] have they're using these agencies today
[14:03] just tactically, how would they shift
[14:06] that over to like an AI platform like us
[14:08] to to go do that same work. So that's
[14:11] that's more of where that time uh from
[14:14] an adoption and implementation
[14:15] standpoint comes in. But the core that
[14:18] core economics that's it's just so
[14:21] obvious. Uh that's one example. Another
[14:24] example there's a large financial
[14:25] institution we work with with trillions
[14:28] in assets under management and they they
[14:31] produce this market insights and
[14:32] commentary. It takes six weeks to
[14:34] publish it. It's like okay this old news
[14:37] you know I need to publish it today. So,
[14:39] what's the bottleneck? Well, you've got
[14:41] SEO review, legal review, content
[14:44] operations review to tag it up so they
[14:46] can put it in the CMS. And like those
[14:48] are all steps that really take a lot of
[14:50] time. Editorial review, same thing. So,
[14:52] you've got one step after the next and
[14:55] the more, you know, in the in the old
[14:57] days to take the quality up, you have to
[14:59] put more people into the process and it
[15:01] slows it down. Um, and in the AI
[15:05] automation world, you just add another
[15:07] step to the workflow and you can codify
[15:10] and standardize whatever you want. So
[15:13] adding additional steps that raises the
[15:16] quality of the outputs that doesn't take
[15:18] time anymore, right? So this is a is
[15:22] this a transformation? A thousand%. This
[15:25] is a huge transformation. The key uh to
[15:29] those initial like the initial where do
[15:31] we start thing is get the quick win try
[15:33] to get you know million-doll plus ROIs
[15:36] that just calculate it ahead of time and
[15:40] then internally at these companies the
[15:43] everybody's looking for the AI win. So
[15:45] you could you can land anywhere in the
[15:47] organization. If you deliver a million
[15:49] in ROI, I guarantee you the seauite's
[15:51] going to hear about it, right? Because
[15:53] everybody's like, "Hey, what what did we
[15:55] figure out this this month?" Right? And
[15:58] it goes back up. And then for for those
[16:01] companies, the things that you need to
[16:06] like the actual processes are so bespoke
[16:08] to every company. That's what makes a
[16:10] company unique is that you have unique
[16:12] processes. So you cannot just can't just
[16:15] buy cookie cutter versions of those
[16:17] processes as point solutions. You
[16:19] actually need a platform you can
[16:21] customize it on. So we've seen a lot of
[16:22] customers go buy like a half dozen
[16:26] things try to string them together and
[16:28] it doesn't work right because it's not
[16:30] built for that. So in the enterprise
[16:34] how many different workflows are there
[16:35] like thousands tens of thousands of
[16:37] different things right and especially in
[16:40] marketing you cannot reduce marketing to
[16:42] one thing right you can't replace a
[16:44] marketer with one workflow you can't
[16:47] that's just not how it works marketing
[16:48] marketing is it requires all of your
[16:52] brain it is it touches every aspect of a
[16:55] business right these are really critical
[16:57] functions so we I do not recommend
[17:00] trying to automate marketers out of
[17:03] their roles. I think you have to give
[17:05] them these kind of high leverage systems
[17:09] to go drive the work that they do
[17:11] through the organization. I think that's
[17:12] a different way to frame it for a lot of
[17:14] teams.
[17:15] >> Well, for what you guys said, it sounds
[17:16] like we got to add people according to
[17:18] what Rex's stats were for the research.
[17:20] But Paul, just maybe for the listener,
[17:21] why don't you give them just a kind of
[17:23] rattle off a series of features that are
[17:24] in there, some of which you've kind of
[17:26] mentioned here. So, there's process
[17:27] dynamics built in. I think I got it.
[17:29] There's alignment to brand guidelines I
[17:31] heard as an element. There's translation
[17:33] built into the product. Do you want to
[17:34] keep going on the list of things that
[17:35] are built in just so people really start
[17:37] to think about all the copy needs that
[17:39] might exist within the company?
[17:40] >> I would say the the key. So when we
[17:43] first started the company, we had a list
[17:45] of tools and those were really best
[17:47] practice prompts that would drive one
[17:49] input and turn the one input into a high
[17:51] quality output. We've since gone into
[17:54] the workflow world and say, "Hey, look,
[17:55] you can you can take a workflow process
[17:58] with steps, lots of different steps, and
[18:00] each of those steps can do an perform an
[18:03] action." You can get very opinionated
[18:05] about what those actions are. So, if you
[18:08] have a a a process step you want to flow
[18:10] through, a lot of these are like, "Hey,
[18:12] look, we need to go research this
[18:14] keyword, right?" So the input to a
[18:16] workflow might be the keyword you want
[18:18] to rank for example and then the next
[18:20] actions let's go research that and
[18:22] understand maybe like the search engine
[18:24] results page right the SER on that
[18:27] that is something that most people want
[18:30] to do but they don't know how to
[18:31] engineer that into a like an LLM
[18:34] workflow and so we pre-built an action
[18:37] layer that is purpose-built for
[18:39] marketers and so that makes it very easy
[18:41] to just drag that action in and that
[18:45] performs the act the actions that they
[18:47] want. So a lot of these actions that we
[18:48] bundle into the product are bundling
[18:51] thirdparty data sources. And so there
[18:54] are a lot of third-party API providers
[18:56] that have different data sets that a lot
[18:59] of marketers want will have to like try
[19:01] to figure out okay how do I go how do I
[19:03] procure that? How do I buy that? How do
[19:05] I bring it in? How do I you know pump
[19:07] that into the input to this workflow? We
[19:11] bundle all of that as well. So in the
[19:13] enterprise now we're talking about more
[19:15] than just an automation platform but
[19:17] really like a cloud platform for AI and
[19:20] that that means I can I can come into
[19:23] copy I can you know get one contract off
[19:26] the ground now I can go attack lots of
[19:29] different use cases I've got all the
[19:31] data that I need between you know
[19:33] integrations that connect my internal
[19:35] systems the ability to go gather
[19:37] information and research it from
[19:39] websites and then the third is to go get
[19:41] it from thirdparty paid providers which
[19:44] again we bundle that in the platform. So
[19:46] again we think about data is the core of
[19:49] this got data coming in we have our lo
[19:52] our business logic that defines what we
[19:54] do with the data how we process it and
[19:56] where it needs to go and then the last
[19:58] piece of this is really it's data
[20:00] management so all of that data coming in
[20:03] we need to store it right that is
[20:05] context and over
[20:06] >> hey Paul what do you mean by data though
[20:07] I mean you're not doing numbers here I'm
[20:09] sorry just can you just go one more step
[20:11] on that for people
[20:11] >> yeah yeah so a good example a lot of a
[20:14] lot of our customers ers have some sort
[20:17] of a B2B motion and they're in,
[20:21] >> you know, sales processes with a number
[20:23] of contacts in an account and the the
[20:27] best practices you need to go research
[20:29] those contacts. You need to go enrich
[20:30] them. You need to go
[20:32] >> look at their LinkedIn profile. You need
[20:34] to look at like look them up on YouTube
[20:36] or on on Google.
[20:38] >> So what what ends up happening at most
[20:40] companies is
[20:40] >> So this is all in support of a sales
[20:42] flow then basically. Okay, great. So I
[20:44] can get information about the customer,
[20:46] about the individual, maybe about the
[20:47] sort of company, about their buying
[20:49] needs. Maybe am I collecting information
[20:51] from other people in the company who've
[20:52] dealt with this company within my
[20:53] company about
[20:54] >> maybe connected to Salesforce and
[20:57] account.
[20:57] >> Yeah, we have Salesforce connections. We
[20:59] have um you know call recording
[21:02] platforms like Gong we can connect to
[21:04] and then you start to gather all this
[21:06] >> all this information at my fingertips is
[21:08] one of the services or one of the
[21:09] elements of the
[21:10] copy.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[21:10] product. Right. Okay. And the and the
[21:12] big difference is that before that would
[21:14] have been uh maybe halfass done by sales
[21:19] executives
[21:20] uh trying to or you getting ready for
[21:22] the sales call. This now makes a
[21:25] workflow where it's consistently high
[21:27] quality touching everything and it's
[21:29] happening in minutes, not days or weeks.
[21:33] >> That's right. That's right. And it's the
[21:35] best reps that do that.
[21:38] >> Okay. Okay. So, so, so listen. So I
[21:40] heard I heard there was an element of
[21:41] adding an SEAO capability to the copy.
[21:45] Um I heard you you match it back to
[21:48] brand guidelines so there's tone and so
[21:50] on that can be done.
[21:51] >> Um is there uh is there something that
[21:54] does legal clearance on copy? We that
[21:56] far along in the world probably not
[21:57] right.
[21:57] >> We have some some customers are saying
[22:00] hey look our legal teams review it for
[22:03] these 10 things are the things that they
[22:05] look for and so the system can just go
[22:08] pre flag that. Okay,
[22:09] >> if they've got that other customers
[22:11] said, "Hey, we have a historical, you
[22:14] know, dump of all red lines on these
[22:18] things, can we just take that and use
[22:19] that as an input to go filter that new
[22:22] content through?" So, we can do that,
[22:24] too.
[22:25] >> Yeah. And I like I like the fact that
[22:26] you're talking about workflow rather
[22:28] than agents. And I'll be interested in
[22:31] your perspective, but um when I when I
[22:34] did the project predictions for 2025, I
[22:37] said this is going to be the year of the
[22:38] workflow, not the year of the agent. The
[22:40] year of the agent will follow, but
[22:41] workflows are far more predictable,
[22:43] controllable. you can have more kind of
[22:45] bite-sized pieces of what the LLM works
[22:47] on within, you know, really pretty good
[22:50] guidelines, like we said, a training set
[22:52] of red lines. Yeah. You know, so so that
[22:54] it just seems a lot better than trying
[22:56] to leave the wide range of probabilistic
[23:00] outputs you can get from an agent.
[23:01] >> Talk to me about because I've heard you
[23:03] you haven't used the word agent, you've
[23:04] used the word work again.
[23:06] >> Talk about how you feel about that that
[23:08] that distinction.
[23:10] >> Yeah, so there there a couple things
[23:12] going on here. one when our platform is
[23:15] API centric end to end and so a an
[23:18] action in our in a workflow could be an
[23:21] agent that we want to call on so one of
[23:22] those agents could be like a deep
[23:24] research agent
[23:25] >> or like a web research agent right that
[23:28] those are those are easy ones
[23:30] >> y
[23:30] >> an agent all agents are API native so
[23:33] you can just tuck it in and so what your
[23:36] workflow is doing saying hey this is the
[23:37] process we want to follow and inside of
[23:39] this this is the room we're going to
[23:41] give you to be creative about what
[23:42] you're going to go do.
[23:44] >> Yep.
[23:44] >> Right. So that's that's an agentic
[23:47] workflow. Is the whole thing an agent?
[23:49] Not really. But it's like the the
[23:51] workflow is the guard rails that you're
[23:53] giving that process, right? And the
[23:55] context.
[23:56] >> So you're managing the context coming
[23:58] in. Now you could have an agent that is
[24:00] a query generator agent, right? So based
[24:03] on all this context flowing in now you
[24:06] know what are the you know what query
[24:09] should we be running on our internal
[24:11] data set right what answers should we
[24:13] generate that's a that's an agent on its
[24:16] own too so we don't I don't think that
[24:19] yeah I don't think that differently
[24:20] about it but is like there are different
[24:22] tools for different jobs that you want
[24:23] to go do some of them are going to be
[24:25] hardcoded workflows some of them are
[24:27] going to be agents and they need to be
[24:29] able to work together in a way that's
[24:30] easily manageable I think until
[24:34] the until you have all the data sets
[24:37] that are kind of core to that customer
[24:41] messaging problem. And we kind of I kind
[24:44] of define all the marketing and sales
[24:46] use cases around customer messaging.
[24:47] Like we need to understand from a data
[24:50] standpoint all the context about our
[24:52] target market and our customer base. And
[24:54] using all that we can go message them
[24:56] across any channel or any type you know
[24:59] any type of communication. And we want
[25:01] all that to be kind of harmonious and
[25:03] consistent. So that's why we we go for
[25:06] our B2B customers broader than just
[25:08] marketing because they are delivering
[25:10] that message through a sales motion as
[25:12] well. And so it does have to go connect
[25:14] back to that. Um and so when you look at
[25:17] okay now we got mark we have the
[25:18] workflow we got the agents.
[25:21] Um
[25:23] again th those are all roughly the same
[25:26] thing. I think Salesforce tries to
[25:28] reposition everything around agents.
[25:29] agent force.
[25:31] >> They're they're mostly workflows, you
[25:33] know, so
[25:35] I kind of tend to use those um a little
[25:39] bit there's quite a bit of overlap
[25:41] between those right now. I think long
[25:43] term you could imagine, hey, just give
[25:45] all this data access to an agent and ask
[25:48] the agent to go run with it. Yeah,
[25:51] there'll come a point where you have
[25:52] enough workflows that are stored that
[25:54] you can train another agent to begin to
[25:56] look at the process overall and figure
[25:58] out how to optimize it. That's why I
[26:00] think that's probably more of a next
[26:02] year thing than this year is that if you
[26:04] have really well- constructed workflows
[26:06] with discrete agents that are doing
[26:08] specific or more narrow narrower tasks,
[26:12] you have a much better chance of being
[26:13] successful. And then you're creating the
[26:15] training set for the agentic, you know,
[26:18] a more broadly kind of AGI agentic
[26:21] future. Um,
[26:22] >> I don't think that where the gap though
[26:24] is right now. Like the gap, the gap is
[26:26] still how do we onboard our business
[26:29] logic into the workflows
[26:32] >> right now. That's still the gap. And so
[26:35] until you've done that completely,
[26:38] um, that's going to take a minute. Then
[26:40] when you want to get to the agentic
[26:42] world, our best like our our philosophy
[26:45] around that is you want to use, you
[26:47] know, in marketing we have personas,
[26:49] >> right? So why do we have personas, Rex?
[26:53] >> There's sort of a standin for the fact
[26:55] that we can't process all of the context
[26:57] data that's available to us, right?
[26:59] >> So what can we do now?
[27:01] >> Yeah, I mean I think
[27:02] >> we can jettison we can jettison these
[27:04] intermediary concepts, right? They were
[27:07] forcing functions because we didn't have
[27:09] the capacity to go create unlimited
[27:11] versions of content. You can only do
[27:13] five and we'd only review five and we
[27:16] but you know from five to 20 the juice
[27:19] is not really worth the squeeze. So I
[27:21] would not expect
[27:23] just a huge amount of lift through all
[27:25] these things where where these companies
[27:27] are now going. It's like hey there's a
[27:30] persona we didn't even realize we had
[27:32] because we could never mine all the
[27:34] data. That's interesting, right? There's
[27:37] a new, you know, we're getting feature
[27:38] requests that our sales team never
[27:40] funneled over to marketing, right? But
[27:43] now with agents, we can we can like
[27:45] ingest all the data. We can we're not
[27:48] missing anything. That's really
[27:49] interesting because now you can take
[27:52] customer centricity of a conversation,
[27:55] the voice of the customer, literally the
[27:57] voice of the customer, and use the
[27:59] agents to route that context where it
[28:01] needs to go.
[28:02] So that's the exciting thing to me is
[28:04] how what is the limit of customer focus
[28:08] and centricity you could have when the
[28:10] customer is literally plugged in as the
[28:12] input to these workflows and these
[28:14] agents can go
[28:15] >> yeah and completely dynamic creative
[28:18] personalized uh
[28:19] >> hey Rex Paul am I yeah so am I clear
[28:21] here that you're you're actually
[28:23] suggesting that there could be something
[28:24] that would meet brand guidelines be
[28:25] within the context of the brand but be
[28:27] individually targeted to that sales
[28:29] prospect if we're going that let's just
[28:31] use it in B2B
[28:32] Yeah, absolutely.
[28:33] >> And based on historical perspective,
[28:35] we'd speak in a language or a dynamic or
[28:36] a style that that person's going to
[28:38] appreciate.
[28:40] >> Are you that is copy.ai that far along
[28:42] or is that what you're building towards?
[28:44] >> No, you can do that. You can do that
[28:45] right now because you can start you can
[28:46] start to even take your historical sales
[28:49] conversations and start to map out
[28:52] >> different personas out of that and pull
[28:54] the the key features out of that. So, an
[28:56] easy one is like your FAQs. So what does
[28:59] this persona typically ask us? You turn
[29:02] that into content and you can send that
[29:04] to that prospect even ahead of the next
[29:07] call like that ahead of the first call
[29:09] which is like hey this is what people
[29:10] usually ask us. Boom. You took the first
[29:13] call from being an exploratory chat to
[29:16] answering all their questions before
[29:18] they even get on it. You've just
[29:19] accelerated your sales cycle at that
[29:21] point. And and this is why the B2B one
[29:23] is a great place to start, right?
[29:25] Because you know, Greg, to your
[29:26] question, he's not doing this real time
[29:29] dynamic with 200 millisecond decisioning
[29:31] like when you're delivering an ad. It's
[29:33] you're prep prepping for a sales call,
[29:35] which you have, you know, you have time
[29:37] time to do, and then you're sending an
[29:38] email as a follow-up or or text or
[29:41] whatever that next uh, you know, touch
[29:43] point is. So, I think that that that it
[29:45] makes a lot of sense while you're
[29:46] starting here. But I think what you're
[29:49] doing will be the way that that all of
[29:51] marketing looks like as processes and
[29:53] systems get faster and faster, right?
[29:55] Yeah. Or do you think you see future?
[29:57] >> No, I think that it's something that
[30:00] everybody's,
[30:02] you know, spiritually been bought into
[30:04] with personalization
[30:06] and great customer experiences. It's
[30:08] really okay. Can we push the limit
[30:09] further now with this new technology?
[30:11] And the answer that's
[30:14] >> clearly yes. And then the question is
[30:15] well what needs to change about the way
[30:17] we operate today versus this next phase
[30:21] right let's say you take a platform
[30:23] approach to that where do we start how
[30:25] do we get through that process quickly
[30:28] and then continue to add you know more
[30:31] things that compound that experience too
[30:33] that's
[30:34] >> so Paul Paul where are you frustrated
[30:36] that you feel like marketers aren't
[30:37] going or businesses aren't going fast
[30:40] enough and that they should be adopting
[30:42] like you're like we already have the
[30:44] solution
[30:44] just use it. Where are they going?
[30:47] >> Now that you know what you got, what do
[30:48] you think they don't get?
[30:50] >> And what do you think is the anecdote to
[30:52] get them to go faster? How do you how do
[30:54] you make that organizational change
[30:56] happen?
[30:58] >> I there okay there there are a lot of
[31:00] question there are a lot of layers to
[31:02] that. The first one the first one is
[31:05] marketers have been promised
[31:07] transformational technology for decades
[31:09] and this is why we have 13,000 martekch
[31:12] startups.
[31:13] Okay. So, each of those startups, they
[31:15] tend to solve for one workflow. That's
[31:17] all they do. And so, the the looking in
[31:21] the rearview mirror, most marketers and
[31:24] even like sales teams, their bias is
[31:28] best of breed. Let me go buy a lot of
[31:31] things and try to stitch it all
[31:33] together. Okay. So that's that's the
[31:36] default mode that doesn't work in the
[31:39] age of AI because data again data is
[31:43] king context data is king and the more
[31:45] context data you have in one place the
[31:48] better the output gets the more valuable
[31:50] the output gets that creates a
[31:53] consolidation a concentration effect
[31:56] that you want to go drive and so if you
[31:58] use best of breed and plop that in a era
[32:01] you're not going to get any of those
[32:02] benefits at at all. So that's not good.
[32:06] Second thing, the I we see
[32:11] and that's not the first one is a huge
[32:14] that's a huge change in buying behavior
[32:17] that's required. Okay. So we're not
[32:19] coming in expecting everybody overnight
[32:23] to get to understand that or get that.
[32:26] That's something that has to be earned
[32:28] by platform companies like us delivering
[32:31] on the value promise and doing it in a
[32:34] way where customers, you know, start to
[32:37] spread that organically. There's word of
[32:39] mouth. So, it's not enough to say, oh,
[32:41] we're a platform, don't use 50 other
[32:43] things. It's another to go deliver the
[32:45] value through. So, I I view that as on
[32:48] us. Second thing, marketers are not
[32:50] systems engineers.
[32:52] So we cannot sell marketing marketers on
[32:55] all the technical
[32:58] depths of all this stuff. They they
[32:59] don't get it right. Marketers are great
[33:01] at understanding customers buying
[33:04] behaviors positioning. That's their
[33:07] strength. Their strength is not
[33:09] programming APIs,
[33:12] prompt engineering at very like big
[33:14] prompt engineering levels.
[33:17] um you know all the technical stuff
[33:21] that's not that's not the bread and
[33:22] butter, right? That's not what they've
[33:24] gotten paid to do. Um and so our our
[33:27] view is you don't I there are two
[33:30] different visions out there. One is that
[33:32] every marketer is going to be like an
[33:34] engineer in the future. The other one is
[33:36] that we have we don't believe in that.
[33:38] The other one we have is the technology
[33:41] companies have to make the value easier
[33:44] to access so that they don't need to
[33:45] become engineers. All right. And so the
[33:47] way we do that is we we pre-build we
[33:50] build the platform and the product to
[33:53] make it easier and easier and easier to
[33:55] adopt those use cases and get the value
[33:57] out. So that's that's our philosophical
[34:00] alignment.
[34:01] All right, that's three. Let's see here.
[34:03] We got we got more, right? Got time for
[34:06] more.
[34:08] uh for okay people want to go fast and
[34:12] when you look at process you know
[34:15] process engineering
[34:17] I get this way more than you might
[34:20] expect but if we ask them what's your
[34:23] bottleneck and then we show them how we
[34:26] could solve that bottleneck I get a lot
[34:28] of questions like well won't that just
[34:29] push the bottleneck to that next step
[34:32] and then they don't want to do it and
[34:35] I'm like
[34:38] yeah you have to keep pushing the
[34:39] bottleneck and then you have to do it
[34:41] all over again.
[34:42] >> Yeah, that's that I mean that that goes
[34:44] back to Gold Rat and and the book The
[34:46] Goal and 40 years of we know how to do
[34:48] operation system management. So you're
[34:51] telling me that people are saying I
[34:52] don't want to do it because if I fix
[34:54] this problem I'll then
[34:56] some other problem.
[34:57] >> I'll have to fix another problem. Right.
[34:58] Exactly. Yeah.
[34:59] >> I can listen and again
[35:01] >> I can see why that might be a little
[35:02] frustrating to hear that. Well, we've
[35:04] not had technology even solved the first
[35:07] problem in a long time. And so they
[35:11] Yeah, even just understanding that you
[35:13] you kind of have to constantly be moving
[35:15] the bottleneck,
[35:17] >> man, that creates a lot of heartburn.
[35:20] >> That creates a lot of heartburn because
[35:21] they they view it and it makes sense. If
[35:23] you have too many steps and processes
[35:27] that span too too much of the
[35:29] organization,
[35:32] you don't really see a vision all like
[35:34] necessarily when the whole organization
[35:36] is going to solve each of those
[35:37] bottleneck points.
[35:39] >> That's interesting,
[35:40] >> right? Which means
[35:41] >> you're saying it just feels too big and
[35:43] vast for for a person even so paralyzes
[35:46] them from getting started.
[35:48] >> Yeah. Yeah, I mean a lot of companies
[35:49] are so
[35:51] they have so many processes and steps
[35:53] and teams and orgs and reviews and all
[35:55] that. Even if you solve one team's
[35:57] problem, the next team's just going to
[35:59] block it and slow it down so they don't
[36:02] actually get that end to end speed bump.
[36:06] Right? So for for us, we need to know
[36:09] that so that we just avoid that use
[36:11] cases that touch too many things because
[36:14] they will not get the the speed pickup.
[36:16] So, what are the use cases that you're
[36:18] avoiding? Because it sounds like you've
[36:19] gone into B2B sales, which is a
[36:21] wonderful use case because there's only
[36:23] a couple steps like the research and
[36:24] some of the other things that you have
[36:26] to do to do call prep. There's only, you
[36:28] know, so much you it's very trackable. I
[36:30] guess
[36:31] >> uh what are some of the ones that you're
[36:33] like, oo, I've stayed away from that one
[36:34] because it just feels too intractable.
[36:36] there are a lot of internal a lot of
[36:39] like compliance and legal and other
[36:42] things where it it becomes like it's not
[36:46] a legal risk that they're willing to
[36:48] accept like an LLM's review on
[36:51] >> and a lot of times
[36:55] they you know a lot of times people are
[36:57] just asking hey can you do this can you
[36:59] do this can you do this because they're
[37:00] trying to like understand what is
[37:02] possible and what isn't and sometimes
[37:06] times they the customer or the prospect
[37:08] will anchor on a use case that is not a
[37:11] good fit. Like it's theoretically
[37:13] possible to do the thing that they want
[37:15] to do, but it's not going to drive a lot
[37:17] of business value for them. And so those
[37:19] are the things that we're going to try
[37:20] to steer around or avoid and say, "Hey,
[37:23] look, you this is likely to get bogged
[37:26] down at these later stages."
[37:29] Um, and that's why these like all the
[37:31] content production ones are really
[37:33] no-brainers. anything that's going to go
[37:35] feed, you know, better content to the at
[37:37] the point of that customer interaction
[37:39] where it's needed. Those those are just
[37:41] no-brainers for the most part.
[37:44] >> Hey, Paul, let me ask you a funny
[37:45] question. This is for the this is for uh
[37:47] I'm asking for a friend on this one just
[37:50] you know,
[37:51] >> how do you really account for brand
[37:53] voice in these things? I I I realize at
[37:55] some very basic level that's a dumb
[37:57] question because of course I can tell
[37:59] chat GPT or anything else it's like give
[38:00] me more formality give me write this at
[38:02] a sixth grade level but I'm not sure if
[38:04] I really understand how the systems are
[38:06] getting to actual brand voice and
[38:10] keeping that as a part of the system
[38:11] what does that mean
[38:14] it's a great question so
[38:16] [Music]
[38:17] if you ask when we ask a lot of
[38:19] customers hey can you like send us the
[38:21] document on your brand voice most
[38:23] companies don't have it. Yeah. Do they
[38:24] have Yeah, that's what I'm That's kind
[38:26] of what I'm getting at. Do they even
[38:27] have it? Right. Have they defined that?
[38:28] I'm not even sure if I know what it is.
[38:31] >> Thing of giving it a corpus of here are
[38:33] all of the things that we've sent that
[38:35] we thought were good quality.
[38:36] >> Yeah. But that but Rex, that might not
[38:37] even do it though because that could be
[38:38] garbage in, garbage out, right? I mean,
[38:40] sort of obviously depending on what
[38:42] happened there, right? Yeah.
[38:43] >> You know, it's your pulse solution.
[38:45] >> Yeah.
[38:46] This is like, you know, um you know the
[38:49] the old story like guy goes into the the
[38:52] uh bait shop and then he he gets like
[38:54] this outrageously orange colorful bait
[38:57] and he goes to the guy at the you know
[38:59] the cashier and he's like do fish
[39:01] actually bite this? You know they they
[39:04] actually go for this? And the guy goes,
[39:06] I don't sell the fish.
[39:10] >> Right. So what we the grand voice
[39:14] >> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So the
[39:15] point is the fisherman might like the
[39:16] bright color. We don't know what the
[39:17] hell the fish like. Is that what we're
[39:19] Is that what we're saying? We've target
[39:23] what people think, right? So when we go
[39:25] to a customer and there's this per
[39:28] somebody's going to care about brand
[39:30] voice, when you look at it in the wild,
[39:32] like to your point, Rex, you could just
[39:34] look at all the content that's ever been
[39:36] produced. There's no that's just not all
[39:39] going to be in that a singular voice,
[39:41] right? So it's a little bit all over the
[39:42] place. You have a lot of people writing
[39:44] for it. it's hard to define it. So this
[39:46] is a qualitative
[39:48] evaluation fundamentally. There's there
[39:49] is no quantitative brand voice
[39:51] evaluation. So then we go to the we're
[39:55] working with the group that cares the
[39:57] most about the brand voice. And in order
[40:01] for for these systems to actually apply
[40:04] a brand voice, you have you have to like
[40:07] communicate with the LLM system,
[40:10] what that is going to look like in a
[40:12] way, not just describing it because a
[40:14] lot of a lot of LLMs, you can describe
[40:16] something and it can't output it in a
[40:19] way that matches that description
[40:21] >> according to you. So what you actually
[40:24] want to do is output it in a way that is
[40:26] consistent with that the the things that
[40:29] matter to your brand voice. So that
[40:31] requires codifying it. We do it
[40:34] uh you know we built some prompt meta
[40:38] prompts that break down this
[40:41] linguistically. And so we have two uh
[40:45] you know worldclass prompt engineers,
[40:47] one is a PhD in linguistics, the other's
[40:49] a poet. And so
[40:51] >> LLMs look at words and they have
[40:54] infinite meaning to the LLM because it's
[40:56] been trained on every use of that word
[40:58] ever.
[40:58] >> Right? and a lot of the duplicate
[41:00] content gets pulled out. And so words
[41:02] can have like lots of different context
[41:05] structures. So what we've done is build
[41:07] this intermediate thing. It's baked into
[41:09] our platform that starts to rip out and
[41:12] break out all the different elements of
[41:13] a brand voice. A brand voice is a really
[41:16] kind of unique interesting use case. So
[41:18] we do we start there and then we also
[41:20] Rex ask them for like their best
[41:21] examples of where that brand voice comes
[41:25] out and then now you can you can take
[41:28] the the intermediate kind of metaprompt
[41:31] layer and you can reverse engineer what
[41:33] makes that great and then output a giant
[41:37] configuration of the brand voice. Okay.
[41:40] So that file you can then reference as
[41:43] hey take this into account and then go
[41:46] do write this thing up right. So an LLM
[41:50] can then say, okay, I understand now how
[41:52] to what this is and how I need to word
[41:54] my word the output. And you want to do
[41:57] it in a way you the one of the first
[42:00] iterations was fine-tuning models
[42:03] to the brand voice. That's not the best,
[42:07] you know, way to do it because
[42:09] state-of-the-art models are getting
[42:10] better and they're flipping around all
[42:12] the time. Maybe it's OpenAI, maybe it's
[42:14] CLA, maybe it's Gemini, right? So you
[42:16] want a you want an independent kind of
[42:18] brand tone module that you can then
[42:21] reference regardless of what models
[42:23] you're working with
[42:24] >> and then that just becomes context for
[42:26] each of the agents that need to use and
[42:28] write to it then and you can update it
[42:29] and you can evolve it. So it gives you
[42:32] can update it in one central spot and
[42:35] every workflow that attaches to it now
[42:38] can go get updated. So, we have
[42:39] customers that say, "Hey, we had we have
[42:42] the legacy website. We're updating our
[42:45] brand voice. We want a much stronger
[42:47] voice in these dimensions." They'll
[42:49] update it, run a few pieces of content
[42:51] to test it, and then they'll go refresh
[42:54] all of their existing content on the new
[42:56] brand voice,
[42:57] >> right?
[42:58] >> And so, that that's that's a great use
[43:00] case. That's a one-timer, you know, but
[43:03] it takes, you know, it can take teams
[43:06] like many, many, many months to go do a
[43:08] full content refresh like that. And
[43:11] that's something they can go execute in
[43:12] a week now.
[43:13] >> And it's kind of interesting because,
[43:14] you know, listen, the the internal
[43:15] conversation we've been having with the
[43:17] people really care about AI here at the
[43:18] MMA is around sort of the degree which
[43:20] chat GPT has become very syncopat,
[43:23] right? It's really too self-
[43:24] congratulatory to me. It's just become
[43:26] really kind of annoying. So you wonder
[43:28] how do you even keep that out of it and
[43:29] how do they even I wonder how do they
[43:30] even probe in program into the thing to
[43:32] say you know can you just keep telling
[43:34] Greg what a great job he's doing which
[43:36] is you know not
[43:37] >> they have they do post so they build
[43:39] their models they do post-processing
[43:42] that takes into account all the
[43:44] attributes of what people like about
[43:47] their historical outputs and guess what
[43:50] people like they like being congrat
[43:53] they're doing great
[43:54] >> like being right
[43:56] that must be 20. That must be my
[43:57] 20-year-old kids. I'm from New York. I
[43:59] don't have time for that.
[44:01] >> Exactly. So, that's another reason, you
[44:03] know, like there you have the Chad GBT
[44:06] pretty general purpose model. If you're
[44:08] in marketing and you're doing enterprise
[44:10] marketing, you do want something that
[44:12] can can remove that uh slop out of
[44:14] there.
[44:15] >> There we go. Slop. That's a great term.
[44:17] So, as we're as we're coming towards
[44:19] some of the end of our of our time
[44:21] together, what you know, when you're
[44:23] doing this, you're right now in that
[44:24] workflow model, especially in the B2B
[44:27] part. You've got some other modules
[44:28] doing some pretty exciting things as you
[44:30] mentioned with uh uh keyword search and
[44:33] different you I'm sure social media
[44:35] workflows and others that that uh are
[44:37] are more definable. What is um what's
[44:40] your thought on how you then give a
[44:42] feedback signal to the AI about which
[44:44] one which per content performed better?
[44:47] Like I imagine you can connect back with
[44:48] a sales call and see which calls
[44:50] advanced, which one's closed, which
[44:52] one's closed for a higher than above
[44:54] average value, right?
[44:55] >> Yeah. How does that how's that coming
[44:57] back into your system or is that that's
[44:59] sort of a roadmap thing for it to happen
[45:01] next?
[45:01] >> The measurement guy Paul wants to know
[45:02] about your measurement by the way.
[45:04] That's what that's what's going Just so
[45:05] you're clear. That's just how I would
[45:06] think about solving the problem at
[45:07] least.
[45:08] >> Yeah. No, that's a good question. You
[45:10] have to be able to save all that data
[45:11] and then correlate the two. And so
[45:14] that's why we built the data data
[45:15] management platform where we can save
[45:17] all that information and bring it back
[45:19] in. So that's that to us is really key.
[45:22] I think most companies,
[45:24] man, most companies are so far away from
[45:26] being able to do that. And that's also
[45:27] not a lot of a lot of teams they start
[45:31] like DIY you know they want to go try to
[45:33] build their own stuff bring in you maybe
[45:36] use chat GPT or just like build a lot of
[45:39] stuff they can't those are the things
[45:41] that you need set up in a real like data
[45:44] warehouse like use case data platform
[45:46] use case and I don't I haven't seen
[45:48] anybody else really be able to execute
[45:51] that now what's interesting is in a
[45:52] world of total personalization onetoone
[45:55] you can't really run sample multiple
[45:57] cohorts on the same output. Right? So
[46:00] the way that you want to do it and the
[46:02] way we run these is build multiple
[46:04] workflows and then route route different
[46:07] people in companies through different
[46:10] workflows and then compare the results
[46:12] between the the workflows. So that's one
[46:13] way to go.
[46:15] >> So what do you mean by that? Can you
[46:16] make that a little more tangible what
[46:17] you mean by
[46:18] >> Yeah. If I'm personalizing a messaging
[46:19] if I'm personalizing a message to you
[46:21] and to Greg,
[46:24] the each message is personalized. So I'm
[46:26] not sending the same one
[46:27] >> like 500 times to get a sample size of a
[46:30] cohort.
[46:31] >> And so what
[46:32] >> so what will be the different workflows
[46:33] that he and I might get?
[46:34] >> You might change you might change like
[46:36] the value propositions that are being
[46:38] highlighted. You might change the length
[46:40] of these things. I think a lot of what's
[46:43] interesting is a lot of the best
[46:44] practices research that still holds up.
[46:47] like people like short messages that are
[46:49] to the point
[46:51] >> and um and so you can still apply a lot
[46:54] of that in there. I think a lot of
[46:56] people still get this wrong that because
[46:58] AI is so easy to produce words and
[47:00] tokens and it's chatty. Why is it
[47:03] chatty? Because that's how they make
[47:05] more money. That's why they're chatty.
[47:07] They sell token by token, right?
[47:11] >> Oh, I'm now I feel like from the cynical
[47:13] part of the world that they're just
[47:14] being wordy because they get paid for
[47:16] it. Oh my god. That's why it's
[47:17] >> they are they're getting paid for it.
[47:19] >> And on the fixed cost one, they don't
[47:20] want you using thank you because that
[47:22] burns their money on their other other
[47:23] end of
[47:25] >> this is like this is like when Homer
[47:26] Simpson actually had discovered that if
[47:28] he would just type Y or N instead of yes
[47:30] or no, he improved his productivity 50%.
[47:33] That was basically what he said.
[47:35] >> There you go.
[47:36] >> There you go. I'm a big fan of just
[47:38] communicating through your input
[47:40] prompts. So when you're like, "Hey, I
[47:42] need to write an email." Just take what
[47:43] you wrote into the input prompts and
[47:45] just send that as your email.
[47:47] >> There you go.
[47:49] >> Okay, Rex, I think you got to take us

So in the enterprise how many different workflows are there like thousands tens of thousands of different things right and especially in marketing you cannot reduce marketing to one thing right you can't replace a marketer with one workflow you can't that's just not how it works marketing marketing is it requires all of your brain it is it touches every aspect of a business right these are really critical functions so we I do not recommend trying to automate marketers out of their roles. I think you have to give them these kind of high leverage systems to go drive the work that they do through the organization. I think that's a different way to frame it for a lot of teams. >> Hi, I'm Greg Stewart, CEO of MMA Global, the International Nonprofit Trade Association for CMOs who are focused on architecting a new future of marketing. I'm Rex Briggs, an author, market researcher, measurement inventor, and entrepreneur. I'm Greg Stewart, CEO of MMA Global. I'm Rex Briggs, an author, marketing researcher, and entrepreneur, and this is Decoding AI for Marketing. Hey, Rex, what do you uh what what AI? We haven't talked about this at all. What AI tools are you most into right now? Is there anything that you're really obsessed with? >> Yeah, I mean, you know, the the tool the tooling is a big issue. Um I still like to build my own custom or have my team building our own custom tool sets. Uh but things like notebook LM of course were were you know just an amazing thing where you can give it a bunch of context. We gave it 16 different uh strategic planning documents that different leaders in the company had uh worked on at Claratoss and we had it generate a 45minute podcast plus some of the white papers and and some of the other industry directions so that everyone in the company could hear where we thought things were going. That was a really cool nice workflow and tool, but the key to it was of course having the context of what we as a company believed and were focused on as well some of the key white papers. So, you know, I I'm looking at tools that are doing a lot more with context, which is I think where today's guest comes in. >> Yeah. Yeah. Listen, I think there's a you know, listen, a lot of us are uh in fact, I don't Rex, you haven't even seen we just finished some research with Canar trying to understand consumer adoption of the main ai chatbots. you know whether it be open AI or or uh you know Daria everybody you know one accla everything else is out there and so we have some sense there's a massive but at the end of the day if you use those tools you start to go yeah I mean this doesn't really fill in all the gaps for me and I can't really share stuff unless I tell somebody else about it so that doesn't really kind of work so I think there's a big opportunity as we're going to see today from today's guest around is there a layer that sits above those LLMs or independent however you would do that we'll let uh him tell us that uh that can really help enterprises work together to better understand sort of how they really get things done and that are organized in a way that they sort of do stuff, right? >> Yeah. Yeah, that's right. And and this is really an important issue. I think the whole idea of context management or content management system for AI, how that works is really going to be important for companies. And today we have Paul Yakobian joining us. He's CEO of copy uh.ai, AI, which by my understanding is a lot more than just generating copy. It helps us really solve some of those go to market pain points and brings contacts together and helps you manage that in in a in a fairly efficient way. So, welcome Paul. >> Thanks for having me, Rex. Greg, it's good to be here. >> Yeah, good. Good. >> Yeah, that's fine. Yep. >> Okay, good. So, yeah, always risk. Hey, hey Paul, why don't you give just a little why don't you just in your own words give background to the listener for what copy.ai is all about. >> Sure. So we started the company in 2020 using the GPT3 models and at that time they were good for generating short form text and so we applied that to marketing and sales content generation use cases and at that time that was really the first application to ever be able to generate net new uh content and copy for customers. And so we scaled that business up and then 2023, middle of 2023, we got the GPT4 models and that really enabled enterprisegrade automation. So you could then trust the models to follow the instructions to take in a lot of context and that really started to help these large enterprise companies solve for that that context management problem. And so from there we've moved the business up market. we are now working with like Fortune 100 companies and helping them scale those kind of best best practice um customer experiences across you know millions of of their own customers and so it has been a wild ride and then in the process of this you know you've got chat GPT coming out you've got every company turning around and saying well what what's our AI game plan here and a big part of the ROI equation for companies is actually mastering that context context management. We talk a lot about customer context management which means it's the customer getting a unified experience end to end across both the marketing and the sales journey. And when they tell us and they give us information are we taking that into account when we go and message them whether that's automated messaging or through our own sales organization going and messaging customers. And so every uh you know every exact every SMO we talk to they that's what they care about. They want it to be on brand. and they want it to be positioned consistently throughout that experience because that's where the leverage comes from with the messages. And so it's been a, you know, both a wild ride, very fun and exciting. >> Learn a lot along the way and and I think to a large extent everybody's figuring this out at the same time. So there are really no experts in these fields. >> Yeah. Well, politicians, I mean, just for the listener that don't know, I mean, I I looked in LinkedIn. It at least says you're d you've doubled the size of your employee account in the last two years. So you guys are on a tear right now. That's right. You took in money from Sequoia and a few other venture capitalists. So, yes, I mean, you know, listen, Paul, sounds like you're in the you're in the heat of the battle. >> It's fun. Yeah, it's in the We're in the arena. Yeah. But we're here on behalf of customers, right? They're they're looking to us to help them through this process. And I think when we were when we first started the company, we had to do a little bit of preaching about like the AI transformation. And now we don't have to sell people on that at all. It is just a question of okay we see this future state where it's you know super you know intelligent highly automated you have feedback loops all over the place but today I've got my our existing you know technology investments or existing headcount our existing existing agency spend and we have a massive like gap between where we are today and where that future state is and mo nobody really understands how they're going to go get there and so what what we kind of view our job is to help kind of guide people along that way. Say, hey, don't don't bite off too much. Don't try to overdo it on a lot of these use cases. Don't over complicate things. Let's let's start and really get that those data foundations. That's really key. So, like what are we trying to actually go do? And then where can we get the most leverage in the actual workflow itself? And that that's a big question I think a lot of a lot of people have when they come to us. We're like, hey, we don't know where to start. Where do we start? Do I just give, you know, chat licenses out to everybody? Is that enough? Does that actually solve the efficiency gap problem that we're talking about? And uh you know I was talking to a friend of mine over the weekend and he's like well you know we have all this like AI stuff like obviously productivity is skyrocketing. I looked up Q1 non-farm business productivity growth. It was minus 1.5% in the US. >> So somehow America's gone down. Yeah. Uh oh. >> Yeah. Well, and you saw Whoops. >> I don't know if you saw the paper that just came out uh on the coders, but they took 16 coders that were well well-versed in a code base, an open source codebase. They had five years of experience. Their estimate was that it would that AI using you know cursor on claude 3.5 and 3.7 would increase their productivity you know 20 to 30% and the productivity actually went down by 19%. And it was uh I mean it's a small sample and you know we're now on cloud 4.0 know so each each week you know you get something more and more advanced but I think that it uh a lot of them were surprised that their productivity went down as they looked at they're like ah yeah well I guess you're waiting for the prompt to come back then you got to fix the code and if you already know the code really well it doesn't necessarily make you faster yet but the belief is that that will happen some point in the future what's your thought about that uh that research is it sounds like that's sort of what you're seeing here a little bit and what's the anecdote for it >> yeah why is that really happening, Paul? Do you think that's the state that we are right now? >> Uh, it's possible if you have if you have pretty senior engineers, they have workflows that make them very hyperproductive and sometimes that the coding, you know, the AI coding workflow helps maybe more amateur novice programmers get up to speed faster. So, you see more of that productivity gain. My guess would be junior level people getting a lot accomplished. Um, but that that's a you know it's a great it's a great great paper. I think it's worth having that not just conversation but really more studies around this. I think that's gonna be pretty key. And I when I look at the to aggregate productivity stats I'm like there's you know we have we have a lot of work to do. There was another great study by theory ventures in the startup world looking at companies that had adopted kind of enduser AI chat tools versus ones that took a platform approach either built their own internal system or invested in a you know platform system like ours. They saw really no no growth net no net revenue growth impact from just AI chat tools and they saw 19% growth for companies that took a systemic approach to to rethinking how their organization structured and I think that's that's pretty much what you would expect. I think in a lot of the workflows that the enterprises care about they are kind of because the workflow is so manual and broken today they paper over it with people. They just throw bodies at the problem. Uh most of those are just like third party agency bodies at the problem. They don't really solve the problem. And I think those are the spots where we like like to come in and really accelerate what the customer is able to do. Those have very clear ROIs and it's on it's baked into that use case. So, let's let's get really specific on that because I think it'll really help the listener unpack what you see as a a problem or the key problem and how uh how you go about solving it uh with more of the platform approach. And if you want to use specific anecdotes or specific customers, great. I mean, I think the more tangible you make it uh you know, I think they'll be the better for the listener. >> Yeah. So we'll start with a little systems engineering work, but most process engineering has steps in it that have task time associated with it. And what AI chat bots do really well is they help you accelerate the time it takes to do the task. So, if you know something comes onto your desk for review and it used to take you five minutes to flip through the dock, mark it up and move it on, that might now take you 90 seconds. Great. So, that's two and a half minutes of time savings. But the process from the person that sent it to you to get it all the way back to them might take a week, might have a 7-day turnaround time on that. So, when you're looking at the entire process, you did not speed it up. even though you use a chatbot, right? So, what you actually want to do is remove that step al together, codify that review step as a as an LLM workflow. That's something that we do. And then put that right back to the person that created it so that they can run it themselves. That that takes that week out of the process. >> So, the b the battle is not task time, it's weight time. And that's what makes large companies slow because they have the most number of those review steps. And so what's really interesting when you look at you have to use project management software, right? >> You're just mapping out how slow your company is. Okay? >> Yeah, >> that's what we're mapping out. So take every single process that's flittering between different people in the organization and automate just that one part of it. you will you will find the maximum amount of time savings there and where where you end up especially for marketers is it is a time tomarket battle how fast can I go get to market so when you look at large companies Microsoft's a great example we're helping them with translation in their Japanese market so it's the hardest language to translate they are delaying product launches because their third party agencies can't complete the work fast enough so They're not getting products to market because >> yeah, that's a huge cost to them. I mean, that's days and days of revenue, lifetime value. Yeah, that's a great point. >> And then their translators are doing verbatim translation. So, it shows up. It's like broken English in the other language. >> Yeah. >> Right. And then the the local teams are like, I can't even I don't even feel confident like I feel terrible launching with this kind of content. So, you see this in the in a global context. they've got, you know, 40 plus languages that they operate in. That bottleneck can be months in terms of how long does it take to prep all of that work. Um, so you start to just like rattle off the benefits and the ROI is not really the issue. The issue becomes, okay, they have they're using these agencies today just tactically, how would they shift that over to like an AI platform like us to to go do that same work. So that's that's more of where that time uh from an adoption and implementation standpoint comes in. But the core that core economics that's it's just so obvious. Uh that's one example. Another example there's a large financial institution we work with with trillions in assets under management and they they produce this market insights and commentary. It takes six weeks to publish it. It's like okay this old news you know I need to publish it today. So, what's the bottleneck? Well, you've got SEO review, legal review, content operations review to tag it up so they can put it in the CMS. And like those are all steps that really take a lot of time. Editorial review, same thing. So, you've got one step after the next and the more, you know, in the in the old days to take the quality up, you have to put more people into the process and it slows it down. Um, and in the AI automation world, you just add another step to the workflow and you can codify and standardize whatever you want. So adding additional steps that raises the quality of the outputs that doesn't take time anymore, right? So this is a is this a transformation? A thousand%. This is a huge transformation. The key uh to those initial like the initial where do we start thing is get the quick win try to get you know million-doll plus ROIs that just calculate it ahead of time and then internally at these companies the everybody's looking for the AI win. So you could you can land anywhere in the organization. If you deliver a million in ROI, I guarantee you the seauite's going to hear about it, right? Because everybody's like, "Hey, what what did we figure out this this month?" Right? And it goes back up. And then for for those companies, the things that you need to like the actual processes are so bespoke to every company. That's what makes a company unique is that you have unique processes. So you cannot just can't just buy cookie cutter versions of those processes as point solutions. You actually need a platform you can customize it on. So we've seen a lot of customers go buy like a half dozen things try to string them together and it doesn't work right because it's not built for that. So in the enterprise how many different workflows are there like thousands tens of thousands of different things right and especially in marketing you cannot reduce marketing to one thing right you can't replace a marketer with one workflow you can't that's just not how it works marketing marketing is it requires all of your brain it is it touches every aspect of a business right these are really critical functions so we I do not recommend trying to automate marketers out of their roles. I think you have to give them these kind of high leverage systems to go drive the work that they do through the organization. I think that's a different way to frame it for a lot of teams. >> Well, for what you guys said, it sounds like we got to add people according to what Rex's stats were for the research. But Paul, just maybe for the listener, why don't you give them just a kind of rattle off a series of features that are in there, some of which you've kind of mentioned here. So, there's process dynamics built in. I think I got it. There's alignment to brand guidelines I heard as an element. There's translation built into the product. Do you want to keep going on the list of things that are built in just so people really start to think about all the copy needs that might exist within the company? >> I would say the the key. So when we first started the company, we had a list of tools and those were really best practice prompts that would drive one input and turn the one input into a high quality output. We've since gone into the workflow world and say, "Hey, look, you can you can take a workflow process with steps, lots of different steps, and each of those steps can do an perform an action." You can get very opinionated about what those actions are. So, if you have a a a process step you want to flow through, a lot of these are like, "Hey, look, we need to go research this keyword, right?" So the input to a workflow might be the keyword you want to rank for example and then the next actions let's go research that and understand maybe like the search engine results page right the SER on that that is something that most people want to do but they don't know how to engineer that into a like an LLM workflow and so we pre-built an action layer that is purpose-built for marketers and so that makes it very easy to just drag that action in and that performs the act the actions that they want. So a lot of these actions that we bundle into the product are bundling thirdparty data sources. And so there are a lot of third-party API providers that have different data sets that a lot of marketers want will have to like try to figure out okay how do I go how do I procure that? How do I buy that? How do I bring it in? How do I you know pump that into the input to this workflow? We bundle all of that as well. So in the enterprise now we're talking about more than just an automation platform but really like a cloud platform for AI and that that means I can I can come into copy I can you know get one contract off the ground now I can go attack lots of different use cases I've got all the data that I need between you know integrations that connect my internal systems the ability to go gather information and research it from websites and then the third is to go get it from thirdparty paid providers which again we bundle that in the platform. So again we think about data is the core of this got data coming in we have our lo our business logic that defines what we do with the data how we process it and where it needs to go and then the last piece of this is really it's data management so all of that data coming in we need to store it right that is context and over >> hey Paul what do you mean by data though I mean you're not doing numbers here I'm sorry just can you just go one more step on that for people >> yeah yeah so a good example a lot of a lot of our customers ers have some sort of a B2B motion and they're in, >> you know, sales processes with a number of contacts in an account and the the best practices you need to go research those contacts. You need to go enrich them. You need to go >> look at their LinkedIn profile. You need to look at like look them up on YouTube or on on Google. >> So what what ends up happening at most companies is >> So this is all in support of a sales flow then basically. Okay, great. So I can get information about the customer, about the individual, maybe about the sort of company, about their buying needs. Maybe am I collecting information from other people in the company who've dealt with this company within my company about >> maybe connected to Salesforce and account. >> Yeah, we have Salesforce connections. We have um you know call recording platforms like Gong we can connect to and then you start to gather all this >> all this information at my fingertips is one of the services or one of the elements of the copy.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa product. Right. Okay. And the and the big difference is that before that would have been uh maybe halfass done by sales executives uh trying to or you getting ready for the sales call. This now makes a workflow where it's consistently high quality touching everything and it's happening in minutes, not days or weeks. >> That's right. That's right. And it's the best reps that do that. >> Okay. Okay. So, so, so listen. So I heard I heard there was an element of adding an SEAO capability to the copy. Um I heard you you match it back to brand guidelines so there's tone and so on that can be done. >> Um is there uh is there something that does legal clearance on copy? We that far along in the world probably not right. >> We have some some customers are saying hey look our legal teams review it for these 10 things are the things that they look for and so the system can just go pre flag that. Okay, >> if they've got that other customers said, "Hey, we have a historical, you know, dump of all red lines on these things, can we just take that and use that as an input to go filter that new content through?" So, we can do that, too. >> Yeah. And I like I like the fact that you're talking about workflow rather than agents. And I'll be interested in your perspective, but um when I when I did the project predictions for 2025, I said this is going to be the year of the workflow, not the year of the agent. The year of the agent will follow, but workflows are far more predictable, controllable. you can have more kind of bite-sized pieces of what the LLM works on within, you know, really pretty good guidelines, like we said, a training set of red lines. Yeah. You know, so so that it just seems a lot better than trying to leave the wide range of probabilistic outputs you can get from an agent. >> Talk to me about because I've heard you you haven't used the word agent, you've used the word work again. >> Talk about how you feel about that that that distinction. >> Yeah, so there there a couple things going on here. one when our platform is API centric end to end and so a an action in our in a workflow could be an agent that we want to call on so one of those agents could be like a deep research agent >> or like a web research agent right that those are those are easy ones >> y >> an agent all agents are API native so you can just tuck it in and so what your workflow is doing saying hey this is the process we want to follow and inside of this this is the room we're going to give you to be creative about what you're going to go do. >> Yep. >> Right. So that's that's an agentic workflow. Is the whole thing an agent? Not really. But it's like the the workflow is the guard rails that you're giving that process, right? And the context. >> So you're managing the context coming in. Now you could have an agent that is a query generator agent, right? So based on all this context flowing in now you know what are the you know what query should we be running on our internal data set right what answers should we generate that's a that's an agent on its own too so we don't I don't think that yeah I don't think that differently about it but is like there are different tools for different jobs that you want to go do some of them are going to be hardcoded workflows some of them are going to be agents and they need to be able to work together in a way that's easily manageable I think until the until you have all the data sets that are kind of core to that customer messaging problem. And we kind of I kind of define all the marketing and sales use cases around customer messaging. Like we need to understand from a data standpoint all the context about our target market and our customer base. And using all that we can go message them across any channel or any type you know any type of communication. And we want all that to be kind of harmonious and consistent. So that's why we we go for our B2B customers broader than just marketing because they are delivering that message through a sales motion as well. And so it does have to go connect back to that. Um and so when you look at okay now we got mark we have the workflow we got the agents. Um again th those are all roughly the same thing. I think Salesforce tries to reposition everything around agents. agent force. >> They're they're mostly workflows, you know, so I kind of tend to use those um a little bit there's quite a bit of overlap between those right now. I think long term you could imagine, hey, just give all this data access to an agent and ask the agent to go run with it. Yeah, there'll come a point where you have enough workflows that are stored that you can train another agent to begin to look at the process overall and figure out how to optimize it. That's why I think that's probably more of a next year thing than this year is that if you have really well- constructed workflows with discrete agents that are doing specific or more narrow narrower tasks, you have a much better chance of being successful. And then you're creating the training set for the agentic, you know, a more broadly kind of AGI agentic future. Um, >> I don't think that where the gap though is right now. Like the gap, the gap is still how do we onboard our business logic into the workflows >> right now. That's still the gap. And so until you've done that completely, um, that's going to take a minute. Then when you want to get to the agentic world, our best like our our philosophy around that is you want to use, you know, in marketing we have personas, >> right? So why do we have personas, Rex? >> There's sort of a standin for the fact that we can't process all of the context data that's available to us, right? >> So what can we do now? >> Yeah, I mean I think >> we can jettison we can jettison these intermediary concepts, right? They were forcing functions because we didn't have the capacity to go create unlimited versions of content. You can only do five and we'd only review five and we but you know from five to 20 the juice is not really worth the squeeze. So I would not expect just a huge amount of lift through all these things where where these companies are now going. It's like hey there's a persona we didn't even realize we had because we could never mine all the data. That's interesting, right? There's a new, you know, we're getting feature requests that our sales team never funneled over to marketing, right? But now with agents, we can we can like ingest all the data. We can we're not missing anything. That's really interesting because now you can take customer centricity of a conversation, the voice of the customer, literally the voice of the customer, and use the agents to route that context where it needs to go. So that's the exciting thing to me is how what is the limit of customer focus and centricity you could have when the customer is literally plugged in as the input to these workflows and these agents can go >> yeah and completely dynamic creative personalized uh >> hey Rex Paul am I yeah so am I clear here that you're you're actually suggesting that there could be something that would meet brand guidelines be within the context of the brand but be individually targeted to that sales prospect if we're going that let's just use it in B2B Yeah, absolutely. >> And based on historical perspective, we'd speak in a language or a dynamic or a style that that person's going to appreciate. >> Are you that is copy.ai that far along or is that what you're building towards? >> No, you can do that. You can do that right now because you can start you can start to even take your historical sales conversations and start to map out >> different personas out of that and pull the the key features out of that. So, an easy one is like your FAQs. So what does this persona typically ask us? You turn that into content and you can send that to that prospect even ahead of the next call like that ahead of the first call which is like hey this is what people usually ask us. Boom. You took the first call from being an exploratory chat to answering all their questions before they even get on it. You've just accelerated your sales cycle at that point. And and this is why the B2B one is a great place to start, right? Because you know, Greg, to your question, he's not doing this real time dynamic with 200 millisecond decisioning like when you're delivering an ad. It's you're prep prepping for a sales call, which you have, you know, you have time time to do, and then you're sending an email as a follow-up or or text or whatever that next uh, you know, touch point is. So, I think that that that it makes a lot of sense while you're starting here. But I think what you're doing will be the way that that all of marketing looks like as processes and systems get faster and faster, right? Yeah. Or do you think you see future? >> No, I think that it's something that everybody's, you know, spiritually been bought into with personalization and great customer experiences. It's really okay. Can we push the limit further now with this new technology? And the answer that's >> clearly yes. And then the question is well what needs to change about the way we operate today versus this next phase right let's say you take a platform approach to that where do we start how do we get through that process quickly and then continue to add you know more things that compound that experience too that's >> so Paul Paul where are you frustrated that you feel like marketers aren't going or businesses aren't going fast enough and that they should be adopting like you're like we already have the solution just use it. Where are they going? >> Now that you know what you got, what do you think they don't get? >> And what do you think is the anecdote to get them to go faster? How do you how do you make that organizational change happen? >> I there okay there there are a lot of question there are a lot of layers to that. The first one the first one is marketers have been promised transformational technology for decades and this is why we have 13,000 martekch startups. Okay. So, each of those startups, they tend to solve for one workflow. That's all they do. And so, the the looking in the rearview mirror, most marketers and even like sales teams, their bias is best of breed. Let me go buy a lot of things and try to stitch it all together. Okay. So that's that's the default mode that doesn't work in the age of AI because data again data is king context data is king and the more context data you have in one place the better the output gets the more valuable the output gets that creates a consolidation a concentration effect that you want to go drive and so if you use best of breed and plop that in a era you're not going to get any of those benefits at at all. So that's not good. Second thing, the I we see and that's not the first one is a huge that's a huge change in buying behavior that's required. Okay. So we're not coming in expecting everybody overnight to get to understand that or get that. That's something that has to be earned by platform companies like us delivering on the value promise and doing it in a way where customers, you know, start to spread that organically. There's word of mouth. So, it's not enough to say, oh, we're a platform, don't use 50 other things. It's another to go deliver the value through. So, I I view that as on us. Second thing, marketers are not systems engineers. So we cannot sell marketing marketers on all the technical depths of all this stuff. They they don't get it right. Marketers are great at understanding customers buying behaviors positioning. That's their strength. Their strength is not programming APIs, prompt engineering at very like big prompt engineering levels. um you know all the technical stuff that's not that's not the bread and butter, right? That's not what they've gotten paid to do. Um and so our our view is you don't I there are two different visions out there. One is that every marketer is going to be like an engineer in the future. The other one is that we have we don't believe in that. The other one we have is the technology companies have to make the value easier to access so that they don't need to become engineers. All right. And so the way we do that is we we pre-build we build the platform and the product to make it easier and easier and easier to adopt those use cases and get the value out. So that's that's our philosophical alignment. All right, that's three. Let's see here. We got we got more, right? Got time for more. uh for okay people want to go fast and when you look at process you know process engineering I get this way more than you might expect but if we ask them what's your bottleneck and then we show them how we could solve that bottleneck I get a lot of questions like well won't that just push the bottleneck to that next step and then they don't want to do it and I'm like yeah you have to keep pushing the bottleneck and then you have to do it all over again. >> Yeah, that's that I mean that that goes back to Gold Rat and and the book The Goal and 40 years of we know how to do operation system management. So you're telling me that people are saying I don't want to do it because if I fix this problem I'll then some other problem. >> I'll have to fix another problem. Right. Exactly. Yeah. >> I can listen and again >> I can see why that might be a little frustrating to hear that. Well, we've not had technology even solved the first problem in a long time. And so they Yeah, even just understanding that you you kind of have to constantly be moving the bottleneck, >> man, that creates a lot of heartburn. >> That creates a lot of heartburn because they they view it and it makes sense. If you have too many steps and processes that span too too much of the organization, you don't really see a vision all like necessarily when the whole organization is going to solve each of those bottleneck points. >> That's interesting, >> right? Which means >> you're saying it just feels too big and vast for for a person even so paralyzes them from getting started. >> Yeah. Yeah, I mean a lot of companies are so they have so many processes and steps and teams and orgs and reviews and all that. Even if you solve one team's problem, the next team's just going to block it and slow it down so they don't actually get that end to end speed bump. Right? So for for us, we need to know that so that we just avoid that use cases that touch too many things because they will not get the the speed pickup. So, what are the use cases that you're avoiding? Because it sounds like you've gone into B2B sales, which is a wonderful use case because there's only a couple steps like the research and some of the other things that you have to do to do call prep. There's only, you know, so much you it's very trackable. I guess >> uh what are some of the ones that you're like, oo, I've stayed away from that one because it just feels too intractable. there are a lot of internal a lot of like compliance and legal and other things where it it becomes like it's not a legal risk that they're willing to accept like an LLM's review on >> and a lot of times they you know a lot of times people are just asking hey can you do this can you do this can you do this because they're trying to like understand what is possible and what isn't and sometimes times they the customer or the prospect will anchor on a use case that is not a good fit. Like it's theoretically possible to do the thing that they want to do, but it's not going to drive a lot of business value for them. And so those are the things that we're going to try to steer around or avoid and say, "Hey, look, you this is likely to get bogged down at these later stages." Um, and that's why these like all the content production ones are really no-brainers. anything that's going to go feed, you know, better content to the at the point of that customer interaction where it's needed. Those those are just no-brainers for the most part. >> Hey, Paul, let me ask you a funny question. This is for the this is for uh I'm asking for a friend on this one just you know, >> how do you really account for brand voice in these things? I I I realize at some very basic level that's a dumb question because of course I can tell chat GPT or anything else it's like give me more formality give me write this at a sixth grade level but I'm not sure if I really understand how the systems are getting to actual brand voice and keeping that as a part of the system what does that mean it's a great question so [Music] if you ask when we ask a lot of customers hey can you like send us the document on your brand voice most companies don't have it. Yeah. Do they have Yeah, that's what I'm That's kind of what I'm getting at. Do they even have it? Right. Have they defined that? I'm not even sure if I know what it is. >> Thing of giving it a corpus of here are all of the things that we've sent that we thought were good quality. >> Yeah. But that but Rex, that might not even do it though because that could be garbage in, garbage out, right? I mean, sort of obviously depending on what happened there, right? Yeah. >> You know, it's your pulse solution. >> Yeah. This is like, you know, um you know the the old story like guy goes into the the uh bait shop and then he he gets like this outrageously orange colorful bait and he goes to the guy at the you know the cashier and he's like do fish actually bite this? You know they they actually go for this? And the guy goes, I don't sell the fish. >> Right. So what we the grand voice >> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So the point is the fisherman might like the bright color. We don't know what the hell the fish like. Is that what we're Is that what we're saying? We've target what people think, right? So when we go to a customer and there's this per somebody's going to care about brand voice, when you look at it in the wild, like to your point, Rex, you could just look at all the content that's ever been produced. There's no that's just not all going to be in that a singular voice, right? So it's a little bit all over the place. You have a lot of people writing for it. it's hard to define it. So this is a qualitative evaluation fundamentally. There's there is no quantitative brand voice evaluation. So then we go to the we're working with the group that cares the most about the brand voice. And in order for for these systems to actually apply a brand voice, you have you have to like communicate with the LLM system, what that is going to look like in a way, not just describing it because a lot of a lot of LLMs, you can describe something and it can't output it in a way that matches that description >> according to you. So what you actually want to do is output it in a way that is consistent with that the the things that matter to your brand voice. So that requires codifying it. We do it uh you know we built some prompt meta prompts that break down this linguistically. And so we have two uh you know worldclass prompt engineers, one is a PhD in linguistics, the other's a poet. And so >> LLMs look at words and they have infinite meaning to the LLM because it's been trained on every use of that word ever. >> Right? and a lot of the duplicate content gets pulled out. And so words can have like lots of different context structures. So what we've done is build this intermediate thing. It's baked into our platform that starts to rip out and break out all the different elements of a brand voice. A brand voice is a really kind of unique interesting use case. So we do we start there and then we also Rex ask them for like their best examples of where that brand voice comes out and then now you can you can take the the intermediate kind of metaprompt layer and you can reverse engineer what makes that great and then output a giant configuration of the brand voice. Okay. So that file you can then reference as hey take this into account and then go do write this thing up right. So an LLM can then say, okay, I understand now how to what this is and how I need to word my word the output. And you want to do it in a way you the one of the first iterations was fine-tuning models to the brand voice. That's not the best, you know, way to do it because state-of-the-art models are getting better and they're flipping around all the time. Maybe it's OpenAI, maybe it's CLA, maybe it's Gemini, right? So you want a you want an independent kind of brand tone module that you can then reference regardless of what models you're working with >> and then that just becomes context for each of the agents that need to use and write to it then and you can update it and you can evolve it. So it gives you can update it in one central spot and every workflow that attaches to it now can go get updated. So, we have customers that say, "Hey, we had we have the legacy website. We're updating our brand voice. We want a much stronger voice in these dimensions." They'll update it, run a few pieces of content to test it, and then they'll go refresh all of their existing content on the new brand voice, >> right? >> And so, that that's that's a great use case. That's a one-timer, you know, but it takes, you know, it can take teams like many, many, many months to go do a full content refresh like that. And that's something they can go execute in a week now. >> And it's kind of interesting because, you know, listen, the the internal conversation we've been having with the people really care about AI here at the MMA is around sort of the degree which chat GPT has become very syncopat, right? It's really too self- congratulatory to me. It's just become really kind of annoying. So you wonder how do you even keep that out of it and how do they even I wonder how do they even probe in program into the thing to say you know can you just keep telling Greg what a great job he's doing which is you know not >> they have they do post so they build their models they do post-processing that takes into account all the attributes of what people like about their historical outputs and guess what people like they like being congrat they're doing great >> like being right that must be 20. That must be my 20-year-old kids. I'm from New York. I don't have time for that. >> Exactly. So, that's another reason, you know, like there you have the Chad GBT pretty general purpose model. If you're in marketing and you're doing enterprise marketing, you do want something that can can remove that uh slop out of there. >> There we go. Slop. That's a great term. So, as we're as we're coming towards some of the end of our of our time together, what you know, when you're doing this, you're right now in that workflow model, especially in the B2B part. You've got some other modules doing some pretty exciting things as you mentioned with uh uh keyword search and different you I'm sure social media workflows and others that that uh are are more definable. What is um what's your thought on how you then give a feedback signal to the AI about which one which per content performed better? Like I imagine you can connect back with a sales call and see which calls advanced, which one's closed, which one's closed for a higher than above average value, right? >> Yeah. How does that how's that coming back into your system or is that that's sort of a roadmap thing for it to happen next? >> The measurement guy Paul wants to know about your measurement by the way. That's what that's what's going Just so you're clear. That's just how I would think about solving the problem at least. >> Yeah. No, that's a good question. You have to be able to save all that data and then correlate the two. And so that's why we built the data data management platform where we can save all that information and bring it back in. So that's that to us is really key. I think most companies, man, most companies are so far away from being able to do that. And that's also not a lot of a lot of teams they start like DIY you know they want to go try to build their own stuff bring in you maybe use chat GPT or just like build a lot of stuff they can't those are the things that you need set up in a real like data warehouse like use case data platform use case and I don't I haven't seen anybody else really be able to execute that now what's interesting is in a world of total personalization onetoone you can't really run sample multiple cohorts on the same output. Right? So the way that you want to do it and the way we run these is build multiple workflows and then route route different people in companies through different workflows and then compare the results between the the workflows. So that's one way to go. >> So what do you mean by that? Can you make that a little more tangible what you mean by >> Yeah. If I'm personalizing a messaging if I'm personalizing a message to you and to Greg, the each message is personalized. So I'm not sending the same one >> like 500 times to get a sample size of a cohort. >> And so what >> so what will be the different workflows that he and I might get? >> You might change you might change like the value propositions that are being highlighted. You might change the length of these things. I think a lot of what's interesting is a lot of the best practices research that still holds up. like people like short messages that are to the point >> and um and so you can still apply a lot of that in there. I think a lot of people still get this wrong that because AI is so easy to produce words and tokens and it's chatty. Why is it chatty? Because that's how they make more money. That's why they're chatty. They sell token by token, right? >> Oh, I'm now I feel like from the cynical part of the world that they're just being wordy because they get paid for it. Oh my god. That's why it's >> they are they're getting paid for it. >> And on the fixed cost one, they don't want you using thank you because that burns their money on their other other end of >> this is like this is like when Homer Simpson actually had discovered that if he would just type Y or N instead of yes or no, he improved his productivity 50%. That was basically what he said. >> There you go. >> There you go. I'm a big fan of just communicating through your input prompts. So when you're like, "Hey, I need to write an email." Just take what you wrote into the input prompts and just send that as your email. >> There you go. >> Okay, Rex, I think you got to take us out. >> Okay.
