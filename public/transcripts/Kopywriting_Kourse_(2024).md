[00:00] yeah well uh dude welcome Paul yakubian
[00:02] you even brought me some uh some whiskey
[00:04] this is this is awesome thank you so
[00:06] Paul is a founder and CEO of copy AI
[00:08] which rocketed to popularity as one of
[00:10] the very first platforms on the planet
[00:11] to utilize gpt3 back when it was like
[00:14] you had to tie in with an API and
[00:16] everything that's right you couldn't
[00:17] just use open Ai No you couldn't didn't
[00:19] have an application and you were not
[00:22] like a computer science person before
[00:24] that I'm not I'm a business person
[00:26] investor I love technology and um no I
[00:29] not started a company before and not not
[00:33] technical so here's here's how I found
[00:34] you guys obviously I run a writing
[00:36] company so I'm very interested when a
[00:38] computer can write for you because I'm
[00:40] like this will either take my job or
[00:42] make it way better and so I was looking
[00:44] at all these different products and I
[00:46] think you had a product called
[00:47] headlines. a or something that was a
[00:49] different company uhhuh yeah or it's
[00:51] called tag had taglines taglines yeah
[00:54] yeah there are a lot of different AI
[00:56] companies yeah it was back in the day it
[00:57] was like the AI at best it could make
[00:59] like a few sentences or something like
[01:01] that ex how did you put that together
[01:03] then if you're not a computer guy so I
[01:05] mean we we had used gpt2 when it was
[01:07] when it had just first gotten launched
[01:09] in 2019 and it couldn't it couldn't
[01:11] really put words together in a way that
[01:13] made any sense but sometimes it would
[01:15] string it together and your brain would
[01:16] like make it work and at that point I
[01:19] was like man when computers can talk
[01:20] what are they going to say like they
[01:22] could create anything because you can
[01:23] create anything you want really with
[01:25] text already that's what people do and
[01:28] so you know just trying to like plot out
[01:30] what's the timeline going to be like for
[01:31] this trend to play out where companies
[01:34] would find Value in these models and our
[01:37] timelines were like seven years 10 years
[01:40] like long enough away you don't need to
[01:41] think about it or worry about it but
[01:44] then what they what they saw was when
[01:45] they made these models 100 times the
[01:47] size it actually did hit that Tipping
[01:51] Point of utility and so six months later
[01:53] they launched gpt3 and instantly you you
[01:57] use it and you like ask it to brainstorm
[01:58] stuff it brainstorms things that make
[02:00] sense and so it doesn't it didn't take a
[02:03] rocket scientist to go okay the time is
[02:07] now to actually go build something and
[02:09] figure out what what do people actually
[02:10] want I mean were you surprised by that
[02:13] because it's just like all of a sudden
[02:14] gbt2 is just like this dumb like it
[02:16] almost felt like one of those SEO
[02:17] spinner services not to me no no because
[02:21] you could create original things so if
[02:24] the way I used it I was like okay it
[02:25] can't really help me with whatever I
[02:27] need for work what can I do with and so
[02:30] it was very creative so I was using it
[02:32] to create science fictional products and
[02:35] then it would generate a Sci-Fi product
[02:37] you'd Google it it wouldn't exist and
[02:40] I'm going this is a fountain of
[02:43] creativity that was a mind-blowing
[02:45] moment that was an aha moment for me you
[02:46] were originally using it for like brain
[02:48] creativity for creativity yeah so
[02:50] because it's not going to it's a
[02:51] compressed model of the internet so it's
[02:53] not going to be exactly accurate all the
[02:56] time at least in the early iterations of
[02:58] it cuz the models weren't that big and
[03:00] so originally the the way I found you I
[03:02] think you had taglines Ai and you were
[03:04] just charging I don't know 20 bucks a
[03:05] month whatever the number was I I
[03:07] remember signing up because I was like I
[03:09] have to see this yeah and I was using it
[03:11] and I was just like this is pretty cool
[03:13] I didn't think like this is going to
[03:14] take anyone's job right away but I
[03:16] thought maybe someone who writes
[03:17] headlines could use this to brainstorm
[03:19] 20 headlines real quick yeah that's
[03:21] exactly right and that was our thinking
[03:22] too we had we had five other uh MVPs
[03:25] that we had built and launched in 90
[03:26] days and tag lion study I was one of
[03:29] talk about some of those I I haven't
[03:30] heard of those yeah one was a a slackbot
[03:34] where we you could just chat with it in
[03:36] slack and then um we didn't get
[03:39] authorization to launch that from open a
[03:41] they thought it was a safety risk to oh
[03:43] this approved open a that you could oh
[03:46] they didn't have a review process and
[03:48] they had never really opened it up for
[03:49] commercial applications and so they they
[03:51] were trying to figure it out as they
[03:53] went along but I was like if I can talk
[03:55] to a model like I'm just going to chat
[03:57] with it it's the same thing I would do
[03:58] with a person yeah yeah so that's going
[04:00] to be the winning interface and then
[04:02] they were like no you can't do that and
[04:04] I'm like okay that's still going to be
[04:07] the winning interface but in the
[04:08] meantime let's like let's scope it down
[04:11] a little bit and NCH down like who has
[04:14] to like who pays today for Creative
[04:16] words and it's and roughly it was like
[04:19] top- down thinking it's like marketing
[04:21] okay well what kinds of marketing
[04:23] content would people pay for and what
[04:24] can this actually do okay right the
[04:26] right out of the box it can't do like a
[04:28] really long form
[04:30] article or piece is going to be very low
[04:32] quality but the tagline that's hard and
[04:35] when you when we talk to marketers like
[04:37] people at agencies or inside companies
[04:39] they did need to brainstorm like a
[04:41] hundred of those T of those like uh you
[04:45] know tagline things or slogan like
[04:47] things for ad copy for their clients
[04:50] like one guy that was um you know early
[04:53] C early customer bars he had three
[04:56] clients that all did uh garage door
[05:00] sales and he ran their Facebook ads for
[05:03] them and it's like how many different
[05:05] ways across you know years can you
[05:07] actually like pitch this to people right
[05:10] and and try to keep keep things Fresh So
[05:13] for them it was very much like this
[05:14] creative bottleneck that they were
[05:16] trying to overcome from a business
[05:17] standpoint and while you were coming up
[05:19] with this idea are you trying to think
[05:22] so so the guy that writes Facebook ads
[05:25] he's kind of directly like linked to the
[05:26] money right people spend money on ads
[05:29] and make money from those ads right were
[05:31] you trying to think like okay who who is
[05:33] this most useful for we yeah so just to
[05:36] to set the context we thought this would
[05:39] reshape how every company operates
[05:41] entirely even from that early stage from
[05:43] the early stage because that compression
[05:45] of oh it can't really make any sense
[05:47] isn't it dumb to all of a sudden oh it
[05:50] can brainstorm instantaneously better
[05:51] than anyone else and when you look at
[05:54] what the trend lines are actually
[05:55] improving you had a
[05:57] reduced cost of computation
[06:00] m a decrease in latency so it could
[06:02] actually do this faster it could handle
[06:05] more context like you can give it more
[06:08] information as an input and it would
[06:10] follow those instructions um and then
[06:12] four as the models get bigger they get
[06:14] more accurate because they have more
[06:16] kind of knowledge that they can not
[06:18] retrieve out of it but it's it's just
[06:20] more accurate overall so when you
[06:22] project all those out and going oh okay
[06:25] this is like a year away from being
[06:27] totally transformational to business
[06:30] let's build for that like how what do we
[06:32] actually need to go do now to get ready
[06:34] for that stage so then so then you
[06:36] change the name for it like tagline you
[06:38] had all these different projects and
[06:39] then you settled on copy AI how did you
[06:41] how did you land on that all right we
[06:42] got two two ways that you do it one's
[06:45] like all right what are people actually
[06:47] doing with taglines and they're not just
[06:49] doing taglines they're doing like
[06:51] headers for their H1s H2S on their
[06:54] website they're using it for email
[06:55] subject lines they were using it a lot
[06:57] of different ways but Loosely all around
[06:59] the copyrighting category and you know
[07:02] this because you're asking people or you
[07:03] just see what they're doing yeah both
[07:05] you can just yeah see how people use the
[07:07] product and talk to your users and
[07:09] customers and so we're like okay that
[07:11] makes sense there is no copywriting app
[07:13] and if you look at copywriting formulas
[07:16] and principles so kind of like a set of
[07:18] instructions and they they're not too
[07:20] long so you could actually just give
[07:21] those instructions to the computer and
[07:23] have it start to Riff on those for you
[07:26] and so customers found that pretty
[07:28] valuable pretty useful so we just built
[07:30] us a like a whole series of Tools around
[07:33] copywriting and then we were looking for
[07:35] like copyrighting dumb ass this is my
[07:37] favorite part of starting this like just
[07:39] going and buying domains but copyrigh
[07:42] you know it's like copyrighting
[07:44] ninja.com and you're like whoa copy Pro
[07:46] or whatever I don't know like half most
[07:48] of the stuff's already taken anyway like
[07:51] copyrighting course.com you know I'm
[07:53] sure you you went through that I went
[07:54] through great PRS to grit yeah that's
[07:56] occupied your mind for like decades
[07:59] right like the name of it and my
[08:02] co-founder Chris he's he slacks me a
[08:04] message he's like hey check this out
[08:06] it's copy. aai I'm like that's freaking
[08:08] great I click on it and it's
[08:11] like uh you can pay $5,000 now or you
[08:15] can rent to own it for $180 a month and
[08:19] I was like buy I just instantly bought
[08:22] it like bought it or rent to own did the
[08:24] rent to own and then we bought it anyway
[08:26] but it was it was amazing I was like
[08:29] this is clearly it and what's nice about
[08:31] copy it's such a core way that people
[08:34] use computers is to copy something and
[08:36] paste something somewhere else and when
[08:38] we looked at the aggregate impact of of
[08:41] AI and generative AI on businesses a big
[08:44] part of it is just adopting best
[08:46] practices so in the current state of the
[08:49] world people write great blog post
[08:51] content This Is How We Do X this is why
[08:53] we do it you know but you can't actually
[08:55] translate that instantly to your
[08:58] business you have to hire someone they
[09:00] have to read it then they have to kind
[09:02] of figure out okay well how do we
[09:03] actually do it how do we actually
[09:05] configure that into the way we operate
[09:07] all of that is going to be get turned
[09:09] into an AI process and so in that world
[09:13] then you can then you could say hey look
[09:14] I want a worldclass sales
[09:17] operation copy and you just paste it
[09:20] into your your workspace or your account
[09:22] and that's how we're we're building our
[09:23] product now oh interesting that's way
[09:26] bigger of a deal than just like a piece
[09:29] of copy right like a very
[09:31] tactical snippet of text it might save
[09:34] me you know few minutes maybe once a
[09:38] couple weeks or a month you know yeah
[09:40] dud I I feel this all the time and one
[09:42] regret about changing the copyrighting
[09:44] course it used to be spelled with K's
[09:46] copywriting course with K's to CES is
[09:49] now it's literal it's like copywriting
[09:50] course so it's clearly a course about
[09:52] copyrighting like there's no there's no
[09:53] doubting when it was KS people were
[09:55] always like why is it spelled with a K
[09:57] and I always had a great answer and this
[09:58] has always been my belie since day one
[10:00] the answer was copyrighting to me is
[10:02] transferring information from my brain
[10:04] to your brain or my brain to a million
[10:06] brains and whichever medium does that
[10:08] the fastest I don't care whether it's
[10:10] text whether it's images whether it's
[10:12] video in the future whether it's VR in
[10:14] the future fature whether it's neuralink
[10:16] whatever weighs the fastest is what I
[10:18] want to convey so if I'm sending an
[10:20] email and it's just best represented
[10:22] with one image and one piece of text so
[10:24] be it I'm not going to like write a lot
[10:25] of copy I don't I'm not one of those
[10:27] people that's like the pen is the best
[10:29] way I'm just like I don't know sometimes
[10:31] an image is better sometimes a video is
[10:33] better than all of them and so that was
[10:34] the reason it's just like it was so much
[10:36] more than just like writing words on a
[10:38] page so and then when I made it C's
[10:41] copyrighting course I was like damn it
[10:42] Nots cool I know I know you want the
[10:44] meta version right because that's that's
[10:46] always a bigger picture well the main
[10:48] thing we have is copyrighting course
[10:49] community and when you spell those with
[10:50] KS you know a few years ago it didn't
[10:53] fly no it still doesn't fly I'm not sure
[10:56] fly still doesn't fly so so here's
[10:59] here's a question I was curious about
[11:00] you yeah your comp copy AI like just I
[11:04] think you had product Market fit it's
[11:06] safe to say right we had it kind of
[11:08] instantly yeah on Twitter yeah and I was
[11:10] always just like every by the way
[11:12] Twitter is like the ultimate
[11:14] copyrighting test how so like if you
[11:16] can't write a good tweet you're
[11:18] nothing's gonna happen oh that's a good
[11:20] way yeah I feel like I write more on
[11:21] Twitter now than I write like blog posts
[11:23] and I'm just like these are just short
[11:24] blog posts yeah but you were because I
[11:27] remember seeing it so like people were
[11:28] just like flocking to your service and I
[11:31] think it was almost hard for you to keep
[11:33] up with the demand which is like Mark
[11:36] Andre's definition of yeah we had we had
[11:38] really no idea what to do so just just
[11:40] like how many people were signing up on
[11:42] like a day or like what's a record
[11:43] something back then was like I mean
[11:46] right out of the gate when you launch
[11:49] obviously you're going to have a big
[11:50] spike right so we had two not everyone
[11:52] you did okay well we okay few okay few
[11:56] tips number one go if you're going to
[11:58] build something something or you want to
[11:59] be you want to start a company get on
[12:02] Twitter follow people that are doing
[12:04] that and they will inspire you to build
[12:06] something and launch so that's that's
[12:08] how it worked for us each time you
[12:10] launch something go like you need to
[12:13] first of all engage with people on
[12:14] Twitter that's very important they're
[12:17] humans and the people that you see
[12:19] engaging on it that's one out of like a
[12:22] thousand people who actually saw your
[12:24] post which is mindblowing like you it's
[12:27] almost impossible to imagine imagine
[12:29] that physically you're in an auditorium
[12:32] a thousand people are looking at you and
[12:33] then one guy is like replying MH right
[12:36] the scale of it's Way Beyond anything
[12:38] that that you can easily imagine and
[12:41] then once you do that you just start
[12:43] adding value to the conversations and as
[12:45] you do that people will start to follow
[12:46] you and then when you do these launches
[12:47] you just DM everybody that follows you
[12:50] hey we love you know your support we're
[12:52] launching this we're really excited
[12:53] about it that's it so that starts to
[12:55] build this little bit of a flywheel and
[12:57] feedback loop and then once when when
[13:00] you go the rapid MVP path like we did
[13:04] now we're launching all the time people
[13:06] are getting excited right so the by the
[13:08] time we launched the fifth thing we're
[13:10] just like doubling down on what worked
[13:11] with taglines we got like 2,000 people
[13:14] to sign up in the first two days so the
[13:17] real question for us was is this a blip
[13:19] or is there any value here and from a
[13:22] marketing standpoint you don't really
[13:23] know until you can see like okay is
[13:25] there any word of mouth component how
[13:27] like how do you actually go build that
[13:29] mhm acquisition engine at least to bring
[13:32] people in and so you know like 10 days
[13:35] later we were still getting like 250
[13:36] signups a day organically which is great
[13:40] like that's awesome that's more than
[13:41] enough to start doing some
[13:43] experimentation that's paying customers
[13:45] no just people using the product you
[13:46] just want people to use the product and
[13:49] so for us that was that was like a
[13:51] moment okay we actually have something
[13:53] here this isn't just like a side Hustle
[13:56] but there is actually some value that's
[13:58] being generated from the platform and we
[14:00] have kind of dris some of the
[14:02] acquisition which is the biggest killer
[14:04] of startups is no one cares what you
[14:06] built yeah right also your your product
[14:09] was stunning at the time now now we have
[14:11] chat gbt and stuff like that it's kind
[14:13] of like it's hard to understand right
[14:15] but at the time I remember I do these
[14:16] office hours in our copyrighting course
[14:17] and we go through and I was like yeah
[14:19] check out this tool copy AI if you want
[14:20] to brainstorm headlines you just put
[14:22] what you want in there and this tool
[14:24] will make like 20 of the headlines and
[14:26] people were like wait wait wait wait
[14:28] what
[14:30] no one had ever seen something like that
[14:32] in history like in the history of humans
[14:34] people are just like wait what what just
[14:36] happened it's like a show stopper moment
[14:39] from that on the office hours would all
[14:41] be about like AI we still get people
[14:44] thinking that it's just looking up
[14:46] something on the Internet and copying it
[14:48] and putting it back in the window for
[14:50] the
[14:51] user I'm like no it's actually
[14:53] generating like what do you mean
[14:55] generated and that's you know it's not
[14:56] the easiest thing to explain to your
[14:59] average user so you had you had
[15:01] something that like people just never
[15:02] seen before they never seen it yeah and
[15:05] um the first generation where you didn't
[15:07] have the instruction following model yet
[15:08] you couldn't just tell it what you want
[15:09] you had to use a tool that's the tools
[15:12] don't quite fit like exactly what
[15:14] somebody wants you'd have to go browse a
[15:16] tool and figure out you know okay well
[15:18] is this is this like a paragraph
[15:20] generator like what am I what do I need
[15:22] actually needed which tool do I need to
[15:24] get the job done so I remember we had a
[15:26] conversation about SEO and I said our
[15:28] top stuff is generators and basically
[15:31] the generators was me working with the
[15:32] developer to like make like you know you
[15:34] put like verb yeah uh gender whatever
[15:37] and then like you put it it's it's all
[15:39] like manually done right so you make
[15:41] this generator but it's just a dumb
[15:43] piece of code following uh HTML and
[15:46] JavaScript yours your tools that you
[15:48] made were like AI creating the thing a
[15:51] new for you each time yeah and and like
[15:53] I know your SEO just like freaking we
[15:56] did Skyrock yeah we did we went the free
[15:58] tool route we we like made some of those
[16:00] free you're making free tools no one had
[16:02] ever seen nobody ever had before yeah
[16:04] yeah exactly yeah so and you're in well
[16:07] yeah but you're also in a little bit of
[16:09] a chicken or the egg problem because no
[16:11] one knows to search for it so it's hard
[16:13] to build an SEO tool that no one is even
[16:15] thinking about too you know like if you
[16:17] look at business name generator like
[16:20] Shopify was pretty pretty early on that
[16:22] and they owned a bunch of those HubSpot
[16:24] owned a bunch so so then so then copy AI
[16:27] I know at at its peak tool um it was
[16:29] like 75 different tools so the the
[16:32] original use case was like okay subject
[16:33] line generator and then to make a blog
[16:36] post generator or I remember you made
[16:38] like an ADA generator I would I use Ada
[16:41] formula with everyone and you made like
[16:42] Ada generator and but you have to like
[16:44] tool each one a little bit different it
[16:47] wasn't like an omni tool like it is and
[16:49] so you you just started adding tools
[16:51] after tools prompt engineer um you know
[16:54] a diverse set of ADA examples that don't
[16:58] cross conflict from a word or a
[17:01] theme like um basis so it's it's just a
[17:06] pattern recognizer so if your samples
[17:08] your examples like hey here examples if
[17:10] they're overly if they're patterned in
[17:13] different ways you want to eliminate
[17:15] that so it was it's a lot of so let me
[17:18] it's a lot of prompt engineering just to
[17:20] get something to be like pretty good and
[17:22] decent and that's interesting so
[17:23] whenever you're trying to make an Ada
[17:25] generator at least back in the back you
[17:28] were giving it just a bunch of ADA
[17:30] examples like high quality Ada examples
[17:32] so you were going across the internet
[17:34] cleaning them up for text entry
[17:36] sometimes writing them yeah sometimes
[17:38] writing oh man yeah so you there's a lot
[17:41] more work than a l more work okay so
[17:43] then you just keep kept adding and
[17:45] adding adding tool like I said I think
[17:46] you had 75 at the peak yeah and then
[17:48] guess what users complain about what I
[17:50] can't find the tool can't find the tool
[17:52] yeah t tools yeah classic classic
[17:55] classic right and then you're like well
[17:57] what if we create like a a search we
[17:59] could like search for the tool right and
[18:01] then it's like we're kind of back at
[18:03] square one you know at that point it's
[18:05] just not so then what were the most
[18:07] commonly used tools at that time during
[18:10] Peak Tool Time yeah big big ones were
[18:12] like paragraph generator because that
[18:14] could actually that was kind of the
[18:16] biggest block of text that you could do
[18:19] interesting and make have it work and so
[18:21] a lot of people would build like an
[18:24] outline and then hit that throw the
[18:25] outline as as the input and then
[18:27] actually generate like a high quality
[18:29] paragraph and then Instagram captions
[18:31] people ate that up because really yeah a
[18:34] lot of people have to write you know
[18:36] like an Instagram post every week or
[18:38] more every day sometimes for Brands and
[18:42] you know businesses I have a theory I
[18:43] mean obviously we do copyrighting so we
[18:45] see a lot of versions of it I'd say the
[18:47] thing that AI has mostly replaced and
[18:49] thank God because I hate doing it is
[18:50] supporting content and what I mean by
[18:52] that is let's say we upload this video
[18:53] to YouTube right now you got to write a
[18:55] description yeah now you got to write
[18:56] tags now oh oh God forbid you have to go
[18:59] and do those uh those tags like the time
[19:02] tags the time stamps that takes forever
[19:05] and instead the AI can just do it right
[19:07] away it's 85% good does it'll get better
[19:11] it'll it'll eventually be 95 100% good
[19:14] and so I feel like those types of like
[19:16] low-level things that you didn't want to
[19:18] do AI is just really good at yeah and
[19:20] it's so fast at yeah it gets in it gets
[19:22] kind of embedded into the whatever
[19:23] applications you're using yeah so okay
[19:25] so in terms of can I say one thing real
[19:28] quick it is fun to see like you know
[19:31] everybody's like oh hey I can't do this
[19:33] perfectly or they can't do that
[19:34] perfectly but then you look at like the
[19:36] job level that people do like a lot of
[19:38] times it's not great yeah you know and
[19:41] so what was actually cool is in when
[19:43] you're building tools you can get that
[19:45] feedback in real time if people find it
[19:47] valuable or helpful and you can kind of
[19:49] figure out what is the actual level that
[19:51] is helpful and useful it's very
[19:53] different levels for different users M
[19:56] and so as you can imagine professional
[19:58] copywriters they're like this isn't that
[20:01] great and then everybody else is like
[20:03] this is amazing it's just like that
[20:07] level of standard I think with
[20:09] copyrighting we think of okay this is
[20:11] going on the homepage of some high
[20:13] volume website and every word is like
[20:16] super critical to it but that's just
[20:18] like a very small percentage of total
[20:21] content and copy that needs to get
[20:22] created I would say that a very
[20:24] lucrative part of copyrighting was these
[20:26] midlevel people that needed to write
[20:28] midlevel copy to other midlevel
[20:31] positions like it it didn't have to be
[20:33] the best thing in the world it didn't
[20:35] have to be the most engaging they were
[20:36] just trying to write a memo to a company
[20:39] they were just trying to write like you
[20:40] said an Instagram caption for an oil
[20:42] change place in Milwaukee it didn't have
[20:44] to be the craziest thing in the world
[20:47] and so that's when people are like well
[20:48] it's not better human can still write
[20:49] better I'm like yeah but you don't
[20:51] understand how much people need this
[20:53] that like average people need this
[20:55] you're talking about Elite copywriting
[20:57] or entertainment like there's this whole
[20:59] world below that where now those people
[21:02] can just do it right yeah so so let's
[21:05] talk about copyrighter copywriters in my
[21:07] like especially like when I think of
[21:08] like old school copywriters seem to be
[21:10] like a salty Bunch sometimes and it's
[21:13] almost like this kind of like the
[21:14] computer vers the human thing did you
[21:17] ever encounter those people we didn't
[21:20] really sell a lot to copywriters really
[21:23] no because we looked at the I mean if
[21:25] you look at the market there were like
[21:26] 15,000 copyright
[21:29] and you're talking about AI Computing
[21:31] going to impact every business and
[21:32] everything that people do this is not
[21:35] like it's not even in the same Market
[21:37] really really no because if you look at
[21:40] all the 100x size the market outside of
[21:43] copyrighting even just in marketing
[21:45] alone copywriting is just one element
[21:48] right of a marketer's job they're having
[21:49] to write a lot of things
[21:51] anyway for the the people that are
[21:54] really good with words they make
[21:57] excellent prompt engine
[21:59] they understand how every single word
[22:01] impacts what the what the model is going
[22:04] to do so we have found value in you know
[22:07] copywriters internally for our company
[22:10] as these prompt Engineers but it it's
[22:13] funny if you follow like the Reddit
[22:15] copyrighting the and I know it's Reddit
[22:17] so there's going to be some of that but
[22:18] it's just like everything's about like
[22:20] AI will this be gone um is this taking
[22:23] our
[22:24] jobs what's what's your thought on that
[22:26] for like those types of copyrights
[22:30] I think it comes I think for every every
[22:33] person's job is like a kind of like a
[22:35] collection of tasks right and as
[22:38] computers get more powerful they can do
[22:40] more of those tasks your job evolves do
[22:43] other
[22:44] things I can't speak for copyrighting in
[22:48] general but I know a lot of agency like
[22:50] big agencies they just view everything
[22:53] as a cost center to them and so anything
[22:57] inside of that cost center that they
[22:59] feel like they can replicate without a
[23:01] customer complaining or a client
[23:03] complaining they're probably gonna do
[23:06] it overall I mean yeah I wish I don't
[23:10] know yeah it's kind of funny I have a I
[23:14] have a blog post drafted out called does
[23:16] everyone just become a
[23:17] plumber no that's the answer for that I
[23:20] can I can tell you the answer to that's
[23:24] no why do why do you say we'll have
[23:27] plumber robot but that's not that's not
[23:29] why exactly that's not why exactly um I
[23:33] think everybody is is going to become a
[23:35] Creator I think all all of these tools
[23:38] makes it so easy to get something going
[23:41] and so if you have an idea or you have a
[23:43] vision of of what you want the path to
[23:46] getting there is so much shorter and
[23:48] every single tool that comes out all the
[23:50] AI tools like oh I need a website it's
[23:53] like same day you have a website with an
[23:56] email account um
[23:58] and you to give you an example my
[24:00] daughter she's nine she's like Dad I
[24:02] want to like I want to shop I want to
[24:04] sell stuff online I'm like cool she has
[24:06] like she's a great painter like okay
[24:08] let's let's get this set up and I'm
[24:09] thinking man it's gonna take forever to
[24:11] do this I we open up we get on a name
[24:15] cheap I grab a domain she wants to call
[24:18] it artshop kids.com get the domain name
[24:20] it's like $6 mhm then we go to
[24:24] Shopify I I just use the app so on my
[24:27] phone it's like 60 bucks for a full year
[24:29] starter plan or whatever MH from the app
[24:32] you can take photos of the product and
[24:35] list it and put the pricing in there and
[24:38] in 26 minutes she has like you can go on
[24:40] this website she has her first item
[24:43] listed the store is live yeah it's in 26
[24:47] minutes she's an entrepreneur now so the
[24:50] world's changed and I think you know
[24:52] education and schooling and none of that
[24:55] stuff is relevant at all YouTube's the
[24:56] most relevant but but even then like
[24:58] it's hard to get that 101 content
[25:02] through because everybody wants to Niche
[25:03] down into advanced more advanced topics
[25:06] but like at simplistic level do you have
[25:10] a phone do you know to like get the
[25:13] domain and go to Shopify if you know
[25:15] those three things did you know it only
[25:16] takes 26 minutes right time to value is
[25:19] really sh and then uh once I told her
[25:22] the site was live she's like she's like
[25:25] cool like how many people are on the
[25:26] website I was like nobody she's like we
[25:30] need to run some ads that's what she
[25:32] said right so now her brain is thinking
[25:34] how do I get people to go to it that's
[25:37] where like that's where her brain's
[25:39] going to be going and that's great yeah
[25:40] because in our era we'd be on day four
[25:43] and we're talking about like so what's a
[25:44] DNS now what what is a what's an SSL
[25:48] certificate it was bad man yeah how do
[25:50] how do you get a server
[25:52] like I was in the seventh grade I'm like
[25:54] I'm going to learn how to code cuz this
[25:55] is like 200
[25:58] 2000 and you had the the first tech big
[26:01] Tech wave came through I'm like Okay
[26:04] Computer Engineering that's the thing
[26:06] it's like cool I get a C++ book it's 700
[26:09] Pages open the first page it starts
[26:11] talking about objects and modules and
[26:13] I'm like I don't know what this is and
[26:15] then if you wanted to build like your
[26:16] own server you need a patchy and there's
[26:18] like a whole thing it it was too much
[26:21] too much effort to do any of that so
[26:23] yeah and and I was using like Microsoft
[26:25] front page and Dream Weaver like build
[26:27] these we you know like websites and how
[26:29] do you style it all and Shopify is like
[26:32] hey look every everything's mostly the
[26:34] same we'll just give you like a template
[26:35] ready to go out of the box and you don't
[26:37] need to mess around with like the server
[26:39] the payment system like any of that
[26:41] stuff yeah it's all gone then you just
[26:42] focus on like okay well what's the
[26:44] business problem business problem is
[26:46] super interesting what's the product and
[26:49] then how do we go find people that need
[26:51] that like what pain point is that
[26:53] solving for people I was in a in college
[26:56] I was in a in like an investment
[26:58] entrepreneurial group yeah and there was
[27:01] 200 people in it it was me and one other
[27:03] guy and the other guy worked for his dad
[27:06] and I was the only one that had a
[27:08] business and the reason was I was
[27:10] reasonably technical right I knew how to
[27:12] use dreamer I knew how to use front page
[27:14] I could do basic HTML I knew enough
[27:16] about the web that I could actually make
[27:18] a web page which back then was very very
[27:20] difficult and you literally needed like
[27:22] a real server and you need to get like
[27:24] had like a a bank account to accept
[27:27] payments then like link it and all these
[27:28] processes took forever and so the cost
[27:31] to entry for an entrepreneurial kid was
[27:33] very high in fact per potentially
[27:36] completely impossible for most people I
[27:38] was just lucky and now you go to an
[27:40] entrepreneurial Club every single one of
[27:42] these kids has tried something they
[27:44] started in a Shopify store they started
[27:46] trying to like resell crap on eBay
[27:48] whatever they've all tried something
[27:50] because it's like all you need is a
[27:51] phone and it's the tools are there to do
[27:53] it and so I assume the next generation
[27:55] will just be like even this like this 26
[27:57] minutes of startup time and like you
[27:59] having to pay for her $60 uh Shopify I
[28:02] assume all that will just be erased yeah
[28:04] in in the near future all the all those
[28:06] things that she had to do to get to that
[28:08] point that will be 26 seconds instead of
[28:11] 26 minutes not even so she's in phase
[28:13] one phase two she wants to list art of
[28:16] other
[28:18] kids and and as a parent I'm like man I
[28:21] know kids like they produce a lot of art
[28:24] that may not make it you know you know
[28:27] mean like that goes out to the trash can
[28:29] or something at some point there just so
[28:31] much art that they're creating like at
[28:32] school and things but she wanted to make
[28:35] it um you know affordable art and then I
[28:37] asked him like okay well like how much
[28:40] how much if you sold like your friend's
[28:41] painting for like 20 bucks like how much
[28:44] of that should go to you and she's like
[28:46] half she knew she knows like take rates
[28:50] you know and I didn't have to tell her
[28:51] what a take rate was she knew what it
[28:54] was and did she she has this in inct did
[28:58] she use AI in any of this process I did
[29:00] to write the product descriptions yeah
[29:02] oh yeah yeah cuz I was like there's a
[29:04] painting she's like oh like what's it
[29:05] called it was like looked like a sunset
[29:07] she's like it's called Sunset I'm like
[29:08] we
[29:09] gota we got to do better than that you
[29:12] know uh so yeah we had generate you know
[29:15] different things title like descript the
[29:17] descriptions are great title's great and
[29:20] I imagine what would happen like what
[29:21] we've already seen with but the the real
[29:23] the I guess the real created thing was
[29:25] the painting like that's what we've got
[29:26] we' got painting and we have somebody
[29:28] that did it and that's an original piece
[29:30] of art right that gets me down to like
[29:33] it it sounds like a lot of the basically
[29:35] I think whatever the economy especially
[29:37] in Tech is like doing things that other
[29:39] people can't do so it it might have been
[29:42] writing product descriptions it might
[29:43] have been making a headline for a
[29:45] painting that you had and now that that
[29:47] part is I don't want to say solved but
[29:50] damn near solved and probably will be in
[29:52] a very short amount of time it's like
[29:55] the actual important thing moves so it
[29:58] used to be being able to write a
[29:59] headline and enter it into WordPress was
[30:02] a valuable skill now you're like that's
[30:05] not that unique anymore and honestly the
[30:06] computer's just going to keep getting
[30:08] better and our brains will keep staying
[30:10] the same so what is the end create
[30:14] what's the process that you're trying to
[30:15] sell so like your daughter is trying to
[30:17] sell like her creative paintings yeah I
[30:19] don't know how how should people is
[30:21] there a way that people should rethink
[30:23] about it because a lot of people's jobs
[30:25] are going to be completely more in the
[30:27] next 5 10 years completely shorter than
[30:30] that yeah probably I'm saying 5 to 10
[30:32] years based on my previous SC internet
[30:35] think for everybody you should like
[30:36] everybody should be using AI tools like
[30:39] and try to be as close to the Forefront
[30:41] of
[30:44] that it's really critical so let's talk
[30:46] about this so copy AI started off of all
[30:49] these little tools then combined into
[30:51] one big Mega Tool then one Mega Tool
[30:53] yeah one big Mega Tool yeah then um
[30:57] exactly one year ago one year ago in
[31:00] nine days from right now I think it was
[31:02] chat gpt's first birthday yeah chat GPT
[31:04] was released into the world which is
[31:07] arguably I mean by all definitions from
[31:09] the past 20 years a full AGI maybe not
[31:12] full AGI it's it's what we would have
[31:15] thought is like a complete artificial
[31:16] intelligence just a few years ago just
[31:18] just two years ago we would have been
[31:20] like this is clearly artificial two
[31:21] reasons why one was the the interaction
[31:24] was natural for the user so it's like
[31:28] time to value is zero seconds so that
[31:31] that experience was incredible the
[31:34] breadth of things that it could do was
[31:37] also incredible you ask it for like
[31:39] simple scripts of code to do some
[31:42] something like I was like Hey build a
[31:44] you know scraper code to go scrape a
[31:47] website and return like the header text
[31:50] it just spit it out
[31:53] formatted like paste it into I have like
[31:55] a repet account and paste it in there
[31:57] run it I'm like does this even work and
[31:58] then boom it just worked and I'm like
[32:00] okay we have solved a lot of problems
[32:03] here with this model it's like a very
[32:05] special moment yeah to be able to see
[32:07] that right it almost eliminated all the
[32:09] maybe not right away but now especially
[32:11] with gbt 4 and Beyond it's just like
[32:13] instead of saying like make a specific
[32:16] tool for an email generator you don't
[32:19] really need you don't need it at all you
[32:20] can do it to make it better you can
[32:22] always add tooling to be more specific
[32:25] because the the way that they train the
[32:28] the general purpose model isn't isn't
[32:30] that you know you know it's not that
[32:34] good for any given task but it's good
[32:36] for the average task it's good enough
[32:38] for the average task yeah so you just
[32:42] have this general purpose tool and it's
[32:43] the first thing that I've seen every
[32:44] Walk of Life use I showed my mom how to
[32:47] use it I've shown like older people in
[32:48] our community how to use it and it's
[32:50] just it's it's simple yeah and then um
[32:53] one of the most shocking ones to me was
[32:55] it was nothing different but it's just
[32:56] the way we could talk to it so on iOS
[32:59] you can enable the voice feature you
[33:01] just talk to chat gbt and responds back
[33:03] to you yeah and you just you you could
[33:05] modify what it tells you too you can
[33:06] tell it to stop and tell you to in a
[33:08] funnier way whatever and that's it's
[33:10] just so natural for people that this is
[33:12] the first time I'm seeing everyone just
[33:13] use AI just as out of the box just just
[33:16] like that I think the craziest part is
[33:17] how general purpose it is too I mean
[33:20] we're used to like companies making
[33:22] Innovations and getting it to that
[33:24] moment and then like that's the company
[33:26] that's going to own that Tech and in
[33:28] this case that's not the case at all
[33:31] it's like Google could you know Google's
[33:34] got a new model set of models coming out
[33:36] called
[33:36] Gemini those could be better and then
[33:39] instantly you're like oh chat gbd is the
[33:41] best oh wait Bard app or whatever you
[33:44] know whatever app you want to use for
[33:45] that suddenly that's the best and so I
[33:49] think you know we're again I think we're
[33:51] conditioned to one company owning stuff
[33:54] and in the back of my mind I'm always is
[33:57] like what Apple's going to win this they
[33:59] the hardware right and they can embed
[34:01] these models and Shrink them and put
[34:03] them on the phone and at that point
[34:05] you're not even communicating with the
[34:07] internet really you're just
[34:09] communicating through the phone that's
[34:10] been a bit surprising I remember with
[34:13] the when I was young in college and like
[34:15] on the Forefront of tech it seemed like
[34:17] the smaller companies were actually
[34:19] capturing a lot more of the value from
[34:22] than the bigger company bigger companies
[34:24] are slow and and offline and they're
[34:25] like retail's always going win right and
[34:28] smaller companies were like yeah we can
[34:29] sell shoes online it's not a big deal
[34:31] and they were just like it'll never work
[34:33] and then those companies just took over
[34:35] it seems what's happening now is big
[34:37] companies are moving really fast on this
[34:39] because all they got to do is tell the
[34:40] developers to implement a few little API
[34:42] calls and Bam you got AI integrated into
[34:45] your already existing product and those
[34:47] big companies already have the contracts
[34:49] they already have the customers they
[34:50] already solving a problem and now you
[34:52] insert Ai and it just does it way better
[34:55] it's almost like the big companies have
[34:56] captured Ed a a predominant amount of
[34:58] the value as far as I can tell is that
[35:00] what you're seeing Market capab yeah
[35:02] yeah for sure so where have you seen
[35:05] like smaller companies kind of sneak in
[35:07] here it's good question so in the you
[35:10] know in like the business world and in
[35:12] startups and Venture Capital you tend to
[35:14] have Cycles you have very definite
[35:16] cycles and usually when there's a new
[35:18] technology it takes about two years for
[35:21] like the big incumbent players to like
[35:24] actually ship something mhm and so when
[35:27] gbt 3 launch I kind of set a 2-year
[35:29] clock I'm like okay like this much this
[35:32] how much time we have to go build brand
[35:34] awareness and distribution that we're
[35:37] going to need right and then like you
[35:40] said okay once the model gets good
[35:42] enough they can just bolt it on as a
[35:44] feature right and and be on be about
[35:47] their merry way so we're now in the
[35:50] incumbents adding AI functionality as a
[35:53] Bolton to their products and the way
[35:57] that that's largely
[35:59] manifested is in some cases search their
[36:02] search functionality got a little bit
[36:04] better MH um and then the second one
[36:09] that's more apparent to the user is like
[36:10] these co-pilot additions where you can
[36:13] chat with information or chat with the
[36:15] system
[36:16] so uh you're talking about like like a
[36:19] law document or a contract you be like
[36:21] when does this Clause expire whatever
[36:23] yeah things like that and Microsoft
[36:25] already has like their package of you
[36:28] know AI co-pilot that they're going to
[36:30] be selling per user per month toward
[36:33] against all of their customer base right
[36:36] and and kind of bundling Enterprise kind
[36:39] of chat GPT against that now is that
[36:42] predictable yeah this like super
[36:45] predictable so when you're a startup and
[36:48] you're like all right where is the white
[36:50] space here in the in the um Tech World
[36:54] usually it's you have a new technology
[36:57] comes out everybody just bolts it on and
[36:59] then the question is well what if you
[37:01] built from the ground uh purpose built
[37:03] around the tech what could you enable
[37:05] and then how do you build something that
[37:06] no one else can compete with because
[37:09] their architecture is built for an a
[37:11] bygone era and so that's the approach
[37:14] we've taken mostly out of necessity
[37:17] again like you're not coming in with $2
[37:20] trillion do market cap and you're like
[37:22] okay how do we add another I think $30 a
[37:24] month per user like across
[37:27] 100 million users that's a lot of money
[37:29] for Microsoft in pocket right well also
[37:31] if they if they Implement a little
[37:33] co-pilot where you can chat with your
[37:34] docs well they already have all your
[37:36] docs they've got they got all the
[37:38] company docs already so it just I I
[37:40] would rather wait long enough to just
[37:42] use that than move to a new company
[37:44] right right for for most yeah most
[37:47] businesses they would need a really
[37:48] compelling reason to move and so you
[37:51] then as a as a company as a Founder you
[37:53] need like a more compelling vision of
[37:55] the future right uh-huh and so the
[37:57] easiest thing to do and this is what I
[37:59] always encourage Founders to do is just
[38:01] say that the the big company and what
[38:04] they what they're going to do is just
[38:07] dumb right it's just dumb and usually
[38:10] bolting on the thing to the other thing
[38:13] that whole thing still doesn't make
[38:15] sense it's still like a broken process
[38:18] so there should if you think
[38:20] about docs and like we have all this
[38:22] information the way that the co-pilots
[38:25] are set up you as a user still have to
[38:27] like initiate and Trigger something to
[38:30] happen so when you take Thanksgiving off
[38:33] your AI took Thanksgiving off which is
[38:36] dumb right it's just dumb it doesn't
[38:38] even make sense when we talk about it
[38:40] that way I think it's it's very easy to
[38:42] get attach to the market idea oh
[38:44] Microsoft's big or Google's big but
[38:47] Google I mean they just faked the whole
[38:49] product demo right in a very public way
[38:52] mhm so they're not they're not in a good
[38:55] spot right now
[38:57] Microsoft they can coast probably for
[39:00] like three decades and be fine but even
[39:03] then they they have this you know this
[39:06] agreement in place with open AI they're
[39:08] they got in put in a an awkward spot
[39:11] with the turmoil there the board turmo
[39:14] turmoil right and because it's not it's
[39:18] not um like the underlying models
[39:21] haven't created modes yet for anybody
[39:23] where you can just pull them out rip and
[39:25] replace and plug andplay any of the
[39:28] models it's still uncertain who's going
[39:30] to win that race and that's a race to
[39:33] spend like 100 billion dollars which
[39:35] means startup is never really going to
[39:37] be playing in that anyway like the
[39:40] amount of capital needed to operate
[39:42] these GPU Farms it's too much so where
[39:46] we where we looked at we're like okay do
[39:49] I really want to bolt on a chat thing
[39:51] that is unlikely to get used that much
[39:54] because the use case of like chatting
[39:55] with a document
[39:57] for most people isn't isn't really that
[40:00] significant it's just like another kind
[40:03] of chat like a search use case it's not
[40:05] transformational the business so what we
[40:07] figured out was if you take the software
[40:11] person's using plus what they're trying
[40:13] to do with it can you operationalize
[40:16] that entire thing in inside of one
[40:19] automation
[40:20] workflow so can you do the entire
[40:23] process beginning to end and the answer
[40:25] that's yes so when you look at the
[40:27] things that people do inside these
[40:29] humanin the loop workflows a lot of it's
[40:32] getting like gathering information which
[40:35] you can either push into this process or
[40:38] you can generate a query like a search
[40:41] query to go query it and bring it in and
[40:43] then once you have that then you have
[40:45] like the business logic well what do we
[40:46] do with this information how are we
[40:48] going to transform it what should an
[40:50] output look like all of that stuff's
[40:52] just prompts so that's a set of
[40:54] instructions and then where's any to go
[40:56] so once we turn it into this like piece
[40:59] is it formatted correctly and let's push
[41:01] it out somewhere else M so that those
[41:04] flows now what's interesting about those
[41:06] flows you can replicate them across
[41:08] every company once you build the flow
[41:11] you do that process infinitely at a
[41:14] minuscule cost and it's infinitely
[41:17] scalable do you have any real world
[41:19] examples of like that implemented yeah
[41:24] so you can you can do it really for
[41:26] anything and marketing you got a lot of
[41:28] use cases SEO a lot of use cases um one
[41:32] example we we look at like content
[41:34] production from competitors or trending
[41:37] keywords and so what we do is we can
[41:39] just build these like build these tools
[41:42] that go scrape the the serp in real time
[41:46] and we can just trigger that
[41:47] periodically to run and then when new
[41:49] things pop up you can figure out what
[41:51] what are like what are the keywords that
[41:53] they're trying to Target for are those
[41:55] keywords valuable or not and you just
[41:57] build these this flow that says okay now
[42:00] let's go create our own content based on
[42:03] our own set of information that we've
[42:04] got that does satisfy that search intent
[42:08] and so you can actually replicate that
[42:10] entire process in a set of these flows
[42:12] interesting I mean this was that's one
[42:14] use case but it's really just data
[42:16] everything is just data some logic and
[42:19] then a place for that data to move to H
[42:23] yeah when you're saying SEO I was trying
[42:25] to think about it I was like what we we
[42:26] do with clients is you basically like
[42:29] take some of the top things that you you
[42:30] do a report so the AI can now do this
[42:32] stuff pull a report where we doing
[42:34] really well if you're number one you're
[42:35] already number one you don't need to do
[42:37] anything but if you're number five it's
[42:39] just like okay what's the difference
[42:40] between my article and the one the four
[42:42] above me you know what it is it's like
[42:44] what 4x or something in terms of clicks
[42:46] it's big yeah and that's a massive
[42:48] difference so if you're already up there
[42:49] it's like okay what am I missing and you
[42:50] can use tools like HRS and different
[42:52] yeah we do this if you're on like page
[42:53] two you want to move to page one that's
[42:55] a big and usually it's something like
[42:57] you're missing a couple of keywords and
[42:58] a section about it and now well guess
[43:00] what there's tools out there that could
[43:02] just create that instantly update that
[43:04] headline say updated 2023 whatever do
[43:06] that yeah and even and even like you've
[43:09] seen U the Google search console data
[43:11] it's like 10,000 of rows of information
[43:14] right well well let me let me ask you
[43:16] this question you're uniquely suited for
[43:18] it so let's say SEO okay so SEO was this
[43:21] game of like who could spend the most
[43:23] amount of time updating their content
[43:25] and not be
[43:27] it was it was such a boring thing I I
[43:29] don't even do it to this anymore because
[43:31] like the value of SEO is like a little
[43:33] bit declining in my opinion so okay but
[43:36] now everyone's got let's say this copy
[43:38] AI workflow that they could just push
[43:40] and it just constantly updates uh SEO
[43:43] right and so it's just this battle of
[43:44] the robots constantly doing it so
[43:47] there's still going to be like a few
[43:49] winners it's a little bit of a zero sum
[43:51] game in the search engine world there's
[43:53] only one top of the page sure and so
[43:56] it's going to be like a couple of it's
[43:57] going to be like HubSpot and some larger
[43:59] companies just fighting out basically
[44:00] for that number one result I'm going to
[44:03] be buried right so what can people do
[44:07] differently now that that's almost like
[44:09] a solved game I'd say it's not quite
[44:12] solved yet it is um that's the gamified
[44:17] version of SEO but but the the more
[44:20] valuable one is where you're bringing
[44:21] that new information to the table right
[44:23] and that's the that's one of the great
[44:25] things about
[44:27] you can take the podcast get the
[44:28] transcript chunk it out into topics
[44:32] generate articles on each of those
[44:34] topics based on the Pod this is
[44:36] something we do already we're doing this
[44:38] with with transcripts internally it
[44:41] works phenomenally well can you explain
[44:44] you have a transcript right let's say
[44:45] let's say this video what's gonna happen
[44:47] we'll do it we'll do it it just it
[44:49] literally say the input to this workflow
[44:52] is the entire text of the entire
[44:54] transcript and then then we built a
[44:56] prompt that extracts out different
[44:59] topics of it then we have a workflow
[45:02] that grabs the topic and that full
[45:04] transcript and starts it builds the
[45:05] outline for you then we're like okay
[45:09] let's take the outline and actually
[45:10] build the content builds the content
[45:12] it's accurate against the transcript so
[45:15] it's not going to make stuff up and then
[45:18] from there you're like okay great now we
[45:19] have the article let's generate the
[45:22] title from the article and then it does
[45:24] that each of those steps is like it
[45:27] could be a lot of steps in there there
[45:28] could be a lot of logic all that stuff
[45:31] is now contained so that you could just
[45:33] rinse and repeat this over and over
[45:36] again that's really I'm glad you gave me
[45:38] a real world example that really set it
[45:39] in concrete because I'll give you I'll
[45:41] I'll tell you like the way that
[45:42] customers want to use that a lot of
[45:44] times they'll have like sales calls or
[45:47] they'll have customer support calls
[45:50] where the C the you know user or the
[45:53] customer they have very they have
[45:55] questions around use cases or like how
[45:57] to get it to do something and somebody's
[46:00] answering those questions in real time
[46:03] right and actually get that to turn into
[46:05] content historically is like kind of
[46:07] hard you know you need a marketer they
[46:09] need to get on like a Content calendar
[46:11] whatever but all that information is
[46:13] actually contained in the transcript so
[46:14] you can just route it now into these
[46:17] content building
[46:18] workflows and it requires very minimal
[46:22] editing on top because all the
[46:24] information is in there
[46:26] um I really love the thing you said net
[46:28] new information that's that's absolutely
[46:31] critical yeah that's going to be what
[46:33] people are going to be searching for now
[46:35] that's what Google's tried to
[46:36] incentivize for with their e e formula
[46:39] yeah entertaining educational whatever
[46:41] it means Yeah well yeah right and then
[46:44] even for the the way that the entire
[46:47] internet works is it's a Content
[46:49] flywheel the entire internet's content
[46:52] fly you upload stuff right that puts it
[46:55] in into this big pool of information
[46:58] Google sifts all that through and allows
[47:00] you to retrieve what's relevant right in
[47:02] real time so over time they incentivize
[47:05] you to create more content and share
[47:08] more insights right with with SEO and
[47:11] driving traffic so that's the
[47:13] monetization model inside this content
[47:16] flywheel now you stuck a a kind of piece
[47:20] in between that massive index the Corpus
[47:23] of information and documents which is
[47:26] the large language model so now that all
[47:29] that content all that information's like
[47:32] compressed into this large language
[47:34] model and then you can deploy that
[47:37] compressed model everywhere in every
[47:40] business process and so in the old days
[47:44] you had to go look up something on the
[47:45] internet right learn about it and then
[47:48] come back and try to do a task now you
[47:51] can just embed the internet into the
[47:53] task process itself MH
[47:57] this was what I got probably the most
[47:59] excited about when we started in 2020
[48:03] because this is G this accelerates like
[48:06] the entire content fly of the internet
[48:08] make makes it way easier for people to
[48:09] publish things so in this trans
[48:12] transcript world you could just have
[48:14] calls all day long and it's just
[48:16] spitting out content on the back
[48:19] end well and it's all new it's net new
[48:21] it's not like you're just regurgitating
[48:23] or spitting back out stuffff and what's
[48:26] happening is when we upload we're
[48:29] describing how the world Works to these
[48:32] models now right you're you're kind of
[48:34] taking snapshots of the way people
[48:36] interact we're uploading video we're
[48:38] uploading photos that is trying to you
[48:41] know that's information that these
[48:43] models need to understand how the world
[48:44] works and that's that's the the purpose
[48:46] of those models interesting yeah it's
[48:49] kind of funny as you're saying that it's
[48:50] like this is the net new this
[48:52] conversation is the thing of bouncing
[48:53] ideas figuring out stuff I'm personally
[48:55] learning from it but then after this I
[48:58] have to there's a whole thing going on
[49:00] of editors and stuff like that that send
[49:02] me the video I send it to my guys that's
[49:04] not the future I think we know we can
[49:07] kind of see the pieces coming together
[49:09] around just operationally what what
[49:11] needs to happen to make that you know
[49:13] way more streamlined so we record this
[49:16] and AI just runs with it it distributes
[49:19] it it cuts up all the clips it makes the
[49:21] clips interesting it gives a description
[49:22] for each clip where to click after the
[49:24] clip how to go the next one right now
[49:26] that's all kind of like under the
[49:28] support of a human ey right which is a
[49:31] lot of time and money and honestly jobs
[49:33] that are like not fun it's just not a
[49:37] good use of time like you're the best
[49:38] use of time would be just having
[49:40] conversations with people constantly
[49:42] that's been my thinking interesting so
[49:44] if if I'm running a company it's
[49:46] probably just having 16 customer calls a
[49:49] day just stack them up yeah and then I
[49:52] don't have to even think about where the
[49:54] information needs to go
[49:56] it all flows into the system the system
[49:58] has the rules about what types of
[50:00] information need to route to who on the
[50:02] team we're gonna have that system set up
[50:04] in the next like few weeks internally so
[50:08] like where does this all so you said
[50:11] like how people should get started with
[50:12] AI probably just using it all the time
[50:14] just trying to use it a bunch there yeah
[50:17] there are two things number one use it
[50:19] all the time number two you have to have
[50:22] a you have to like reenter yourself and
[50:26] really understand what you want to do
[50:31] personally that's something that people
[50:33] don't do enough of they don't really a
[50:36] lot of people aren't thinking right now
[50:38] they're on their they're just scrolling
[50:40] through the
[50:41] feed
[50:42] constantly
[50:44] right and that's not how we need to live
[50:47] our lives the feed I OD like ideally the
[50:50] feed just goes away it would just hang
[50:53] out that's to me that's a way better
[50:56] future than the feed gets more addictive
[50:59] because you have more content more
[51:01] opportunities in the neural net to match
[51:04] content that's going to resonate a part
[51:05] of your brain better I don't think
[51:08] that's a good idea so I sent you a
[51:11] present purpose of that present this a
[51:13] typewriter is for you to actually not be
[51:16] distracted by technology and like start
[51:19] to try to communicate your own thoughts
[51:21] to yourself MH like very
[51:24] consciously and I found that to be quite
[51:26] therapeutic I mean I just like smash
[51:30] out stuff all the time now on my
[51:32] typewriter and it's it's given me a much
[51:35] firmer foundation for like things that I
[51:38] want to do even my own thoughts like if
[51:42] you've had thoughts that other people
[51:44] aren't validating or aren't popular like
[51:46] you don't you don't just want to get rid
[51:48] of those you want to actually make make
[51:50] those very clear to yourself you know
[51:51] what it is and why MH and so I think you
[51:54] have to pair both of those together
[51:55] like if my daughter
[51:57] says well the AI can do it I don't need
[52:00] to learn
[52:01] anything right I don't think that that
[52:04] is going to end up you're not going to
[52:05] end up in a good spot right because the
[52:09] the pace of change would encourage that
[52:12] Viewpoint right like why should I learn
[52:15] anything if a computer is GNA learn how
[52:17] to do
[52:18] it that is that is a valid question
[52:22] right yeah yeah so to me that's a very
[52:25] that's it's a very core question we need
[52:26] to be discussing MH and I don't think
[52:31] it's
[52:32] a like for me personally I would just
[52:34] always I'd hedge that and say that's
[52:37] like no it's you still need to learn
[52:39] something but it's a question that I
[52:41] think would play into a lot of the
[52:45] uh cultural memes especially around like
[52:48] anti-work stuff like you've seen this
[52:50] Reddit subreddit Trend I'm like is this
[52:54] China That's pushing this narrative on
[52:56] Americans like I have no idea where this
[52:58] narrative comes from but it's toxic to
[53:00] your culture so I I'm wondering I'm on
[53:03] the lookout for any of these narratives
[53:05] that are very toxic the culture and hard
[53:07] work because I think I know at least for
[53:10] me I found a lot of value personally in
[53:13] hard work and accomplishing things and
[53:15] feeling like I'm learning I think that's
[53:17] important regardless of what computers
[53:20] can do so when I and when you have a
[53:23] vision of what you want
[53:25] let's say I want to get over here and a
[53:28] computer comes along it should just help
[53:30] me get there faster so this should be a
[53:33] tailwind and so if you feel like
[53:35] computers getting smarter faster
[53:38] whatever are a
[53:39] threat I would recommend you think about
[53:42] how to reposition what you want in such
[53:45] a way that it's a Tailwind for you it
[53:46] helps you get what you want well let's
[53:50] let's travel back 20 years or so I was
[53:52] graduating high school going to college
[53:56] um hundreds of thousands of people maybe
[53:58] Millions I don't know worked with
[54:00] newspapers like the newspaper got
[54:02] delivered every day and you read it like
[54:04] like you you physically read this thing
[54:06] that someone printed with with metal
[54:08] right onto ink and then a dude drove it
[54:10] to your house right at 5:30 in the
[54:12] morning right that was a real thing
[54:14] that's how everyone got their news in
[54:15] the world it is pretty cool it's like if
[54:17] you printed the internet it it is it is
[54:19] stunning that it actually worked yeah
[54:21] right and then it's just like at that
[54:23] time becoming like a journalist was like
[54:25] this really hard thing cuz people people
[54:27] are still to some degree typing on
[54:28] typewriters computers are already kind
[54:30] of the norm but like not really the
[54:32] internet at the moment and so every
[54:34] single job that I've seen has been
[54:37] impacted by the internet within 20 years
[54:40] right and now that we're mostly digital
[54:42] those changes are going to take place at
[54:44] a different clock speed probably faster
[54:46] probably half each time and it'll just
[54:48] get faster and faster and faster um so
[54:51] even if you are a plumber the way I've
[54:54] hired I hired a plumber
[54:55] to install a cool new Japanese toilet
[54:57] and where did I find him on the internet
[54:59] how did I meet him through a chat app PL
[55:01] has been doing really well I don't know
[55:03] if you've you paid the bill yet but
[55:05] they're not they're not cheap but but
[55:07] this is why I wrote a blog post draft
[55:09] called like does everyone become a
[55:10] plumber because in the end all the stuff
[55:12] we're doing with tech like I'm writing
[55:14] stuff for people it's just like at some
[55:15] point if this gets replaced by a
[55:17] computer could do it really well I
[55:20] should be doing something that a
[55:21] computer can't do I should be in that
[55:23] frame where a computer can't and right
[55:24] now computer can't really move this from
[55:26] here to there that well yeah at least
[55:28] not a general robot we're still a little
[55:30] bit away from robot no we're not that
[55:32] far at some point it'll be no we're not
[55:34] that far well well here's the thing my
[55:36] thesis is like short-term medium-term
[55:38] and long-term and at the point way how
[55:40] do I make how do I preserve myself how
[55:41] do I make money how do I how do I stay
[55:43] ahead of all this in the long run right
[55:46] I cannot I've tried unless we all bomb
[55:49] ourselves back to the Stone Age and then
[55:50] I'm dead before then we don't I don't
[55:53] see a world where we don't all become
[55:57] robots it's an interesting question but
[55:59] but I almost don't see any way that that
[56:02] doesn't happen and for us I think that
[56:04] seems scary but for but I try to
[56:06] position myself 50 years in the future
[56:08] as a robot and I look back on the
[56:10] barbaric times of of me me and Paul
[56:13] sitting in a room together having to
[56:15] breathe oxygen that's at the perfect
[56:16] level so we don't die you flew on a big
[56:19] metal bird over here to get so dumb yeah
[56:22] went through all it's like all these
[56:23] things oh um if I hit you in the it'll
[56:25] hurt you a robot will be like yeah hit
[56:27] me in the face all you want it doesn't
[56:28] matter it's no big it's fun no I'm not a
[56:30] big robot fan but but we all become
[56:33] robots eventually right like we are
[56:34] already partially robot is someone's
[56:36] watching this they are watching us on a
[56:37] robot we're being recorded by a robot
[56:39] this is a robot my phone has a robot I
[56:42] mean if your knee goes bad and you get
[56:44] an implant it's like metal that's pretty
[56:47] dope you
[56:48] know so I mean that's why that's why I
[56:50] think being robots would be we're
[56:52] already biomechanical in many ways yeah
[56:55] yeah so I don't think it would be better
[56:57] like again I think you need a you need a
[56:59] very concrete definition of what you
[57:00] want well what if what you value I I
[57:03] thought I've thought about this a lot
[57:04] too I'll give you an example you
[57:05] mentioned the plumbers and my my brain
[57:08] goes in a million different directions
[57:09] one of which is as people uh at least in
[57:12] the US have gotten wealthier the size of
[57:14] our houses have gotten bigger over time
[57:17] so I think in like 1950 the average size
[57:20] of the house was like 1,200 square feet
[57:21] now it's like 3,000 of of new ones and
[57:25] so I'm like okay if we get so incredibly
[57:27] wealthy from all this Ai and computation
[57:29] like how big is the house going to get
[57:32] you know and I'm like okay a 20,000 foot
[57:35] house and I'm like how many toilets is
[57:36] that you know so you're talking about
[57:38] the flamber slapping a job right I'm
[57:40] like if the house just continues to grow
[57:43] like at that same clip everybody's in a
[57:46] freaking Palace you've seen these houses
[57:49] right everybody is like on
[57:51] Zillow like browsing these insane houses
[57:55] mhm so we are wealthier we don't feel
[57:58] any better we probably even feel worse
[58:00] and so that's why it's really important
[58:02] for everybody like be very Mindful and
[58:04] conscious of okay even if we get this
[58:07] economic growth on paper is life better
[58:10] or not yeah I would argue for most
[58:13] people it doesn't seem like it's getting
[58:15] better for them their life's not getting
[58:16] better like the the phone becomes more
[58:19] addictive because the content amount of
[58:22] content's
[58:23] growing the algorithms get better but if
[58:27] you could but there is an argument that
[58:29] like if we're just aliens looking at
[58:31] humans and we were just objective about
[58:32] like what's better you'd say like are
[58:34] they having more happy experiences than
[58:36] sad experiences and for the most part
[58:37] like people aren't dying all over the
[58:39] streets yeah you know like we we we
[58:41] don't think like uh looking at a
[58:43] mountain causes you to die or something
[58:45] a good question I don't know I think
[58:46] time scales are different we're we're
[58:49] still biologically wired right and now
[58:52] we're introduced to phones that are 6 in
[58:54] from our face that are programmed to
[58:57] like get us to react in certain ways I
[59:00] don't think the human brain can even
[59:03] function against that I don't think
[59:05] there are enough blockers against that
[59:06] so I think that's an issue yeah I think
[59:10] I think long time frame I'm talking 100
[59:12] years there's we're fully digital
[59:15] basically is is the way I see it digital
[59:17] species yeah now now you can always you
[59:19] could always do this thing where you
[59:20] time scale it's like oh the heat death
[59:22] of the universe everything's going to
[59:23] die in 10 billion years okay fine that's
[59:25] but that's so far away we do have
[59:27] current time frame problems first so I
[59:29] try to divide it into three different
[59:31] parts the the the very longterm let's
[59:33] say we become like all robots and we're
[59:35] all just somewhere in a server can I can
[59:38] I say something real quick yeah
[59:39] everybody's scenario mapping always maps
[59:42] to some
[59:44] movie yeah but that to me is like that's
[59:48] not the best thing well I think I think
[59:51] thinking about it in a hundred years is
[59:52] a hypothetical thing right I would't the
[59:55] like either it's like uh whatever um
[60:00] it's like the Matrix right like that's a
[60:02] very common one you know like just
[60:04] people mentally mapping to movies that
[60:07] were they're all very much like horror
[60:09] movies I feel like I don't I don't
[60:11] personally think they're all I think
[60:13] obviously if you have a movie you have
[60:14] to make it horror movie because it's not
[60:16] interesting if it's just all nice let
[60:17] ask you this like yeah you take let's
[60:19] say you and all your friends took the
[60:21] day off and you're all going to hang out
[60:23] together what are you doing going ATV
[60:25] going shoot some guns and hanging out
[60:28] chitchatting that's the [ __ ] future
[60:30] yeah and so so that's it's not the
[60:32] Matrix we we watch The Matrix but I do
[60:34] think that if look that day off I swear
[60:37] to you is the [ __ ] future and if you
[60:39] told people hey we don't need you to
[60:41] work anymore so you've got the day off
[60:43] like you know for a long time you're
[60:46] [ __ ] hang out we could do it well I
[60:49] think it's moving more and more towards
[60:51] that most of the people we know that's
[60:53] kind of their life right do they like it
[60:56] I think so yeah they [ __ ] love it so
[60:59] I I wouldn't worry too much about like
[61:01] they're not giving it up let's just say
[61:02] that yeah I wouldn't worry I wouldn't
[61:03] worry too much about like these overly
[61:05] pessimistic versions of the future I
[61:07] think the things that make us happy are
[61:09] are really straightforward I think
[61:11] probably mortality obviously an A+
[61:15] problem for individuals right which I
[61:18] think we'll probably
[61:19] solve so okay so you have you you have
[61:22] kids uh what would what are you training
[61:25] them to do so that they would be best
[61:27] set up in their future what are the
[61:30] skills that that you're
[61:32] instilling uh
[61:35] entrepreneurship that's pretty key and
[61:36] at a younger age I think from what I
[61:38] could tell most successful people they
[61:42] did something before they graduated high
[61:44] school whether that was like newspaper
[61:46] like throw newspapers and old days
[61:49] building websites M selling candy
[61:53] something just get that brand brain
[61:54] working around how do I how do I take my
[61:59] resources and use that to help somebody
[62:01] else in a way that I get more resources
[62:03] back and just think start to think and
[62:06] get those gears moving because I don't
[62:09] know what what's happened in um like
[62:11] colleges for example but none of the
[62:13] people that taught any of the courses
[62:15] have ever created any businesses so like
[62:17] you're not ever going to learn anything
[62:19] from them at all and all that stuff
[62:22] that's old and chat gbt to me was a
[62:24] moment to go okay we don't need like
[62:26] half the universities
[62:28] anymore and so we just don't have those
[62:31] conversations outside of watching like
[62:35] Peter teal videos on YouTube like you
[62:38] know 10 years ago talking about this so
[62:40] like it's just a matter of time before
[62:43] that people actually act on that
[62:46] information and so right now for
[62:50] kids like you need you need to have like
[62:52] high moral and ethical standard
[62:55] standards period so that's something you
[62:58] cannot you know you have to educate and
[63:01] teach around that uh two is like
[63:04] curiosity that's really key three is
[63:06] physical activity gotta have physical
[63:08] activity America America needs physical
[63:12] activity um and then for like I said
[63:15] some some amount of Entrepreneurship but
[63:17] it's really that to me is like a
[63:19] classical like the newvo liberal arts
[63:22] education is just being well arounded
[63:23] and being interesting H interesting good
[63:27] points yeah thanks for doing this man
[63:28] thanks man appreciate it
[63:35] yeah

## Full Text (No Timestamps)

yeah well uh dude welcome Paul yakubian you even brought me some uh some whiskey this is this is awesome thank you so Paul is a founder and CEO of copy AI which rocketed to popularity as one of the very first platforms on the planet to utilize gpt3 back when it was like you had to tie in with an API and everything that's right you couldn't just use open Ai No you couldn't didn't have an application and you were not like a computer science person before that I'm not I'm a business person investor I love technology and um no I not started a company before and not not technical so here's here's how I found you guys obviously I run a writing company so I'm very interested when a computer can write for you because I'm like this will either take my job or make it way better and so I was looking at all these different products and I think you had a product called headlines. a or something that was a different company uhhuh yeah or it's called tag had taglines taglines yeah yeah there are a lot of different AI companies yeah it was back in the day it was like the AI at best it could make like a few sentences or something like that ex how did you put that together then if you're not a computer guy so I mean we we had used gpt2 when it was when it had just first gotten launched in 2019 and it couldn't it couldn't really put words together in a way that made any sense but sometimes it would string it together and your brain would like make it work and at that point I was like man when computers can talk what are they going to say like they could create anything because you can create anything you want really with text already that's what people do and so you know just trying to like plot out what's the timeline going to be like for this trend to play out where companies would find Value in these models and our timelines were like seven years 10 years like long enough away you don't need to think about it or worry about it but then what they what they saw was when they made these models 100 times the size it actually did hit that Tipping Point of utility and so six months later they launched gpt3 and instantly you you use it and you like ask it to brainstorm stuff it brainstorms things that make sense and so it doesn't it didn't take a rocket scientist to go okay the time is now to actually go build something and figure out what what do people actually want I mean were you surprised by that because it's just like all of a sudden gbt2 is just like this dumb like it almost felt like one of those SEO spinner services not to me no no because you could create original things so if the way I used it I was like okay it can't really help me with whatever I need for work what can I do with and so it was very creative so I was using it to create science fictional products and then it would generate a Sci-Fi product you'd Google it it wouldn't exist and I'm going this is a fountain of creativity that was a mind-blowing moment that was an aha moment for me you were originally using it for like brain creativity for creativity yeah so because it's not going to it's a compressed model of the internet so it's not going to be exactly accurate all the time at least in the early iterations of it cuz the models weren't that big and so originally the the way I found you I think you had taglines Ai and you were just charging I don't know 20 bucks a month whatever the number was I I remember signing up because I was like I have to see this yeah and I was using it and I was just like this is pretty cool I didn't think like this is going to take anyone's job right away but I thought maybe someone who writes headlines could use this to brainstorm 20 headlines real quick yeah that's exactly right and that was our thinking too we had we had five other uh MVPs that we had built and launched in 90 days and tag lion study I was one of talk about some of those I I haven't heard of those yeah one was a a slackbot where we you could just chat with it in slack and then um we didn't get authorization to launch that from open a they thought it was a safety risk to oh this approved open a that you could oh they didn't have a review process and they had never really opened it up for commercial applications and so they they were trying to figure it out as they went along but I was like if I can talk to a model like I'm just going to chat with it it's the same thing I would do with a person yeah yeah so that's going to be the winning interface and then they were like no you can't do that and I'm like okay that's still going to be the winning interface but in the meantime let's like let's scope it down a little bit and NCH down like who has to like who pays today for Creative words and it's and roughly it was like top- down thinking it's like marketing okay well what kinds of marketing content would people pay for and what can this actually do okay right the right out of the box it can't do like a really long form article or piece is going to be very low quality but the tagline that's hard and when you when we talk to marketers like people at agencies or inside companies they did need to brainstorm like a hundred of those T of those like uh you know tagline things or slogan like things for ad copy for their clients like one guy that was um you know early C early customer bars he had three clients that all did uh garage door sales and he ran their Facebook ads for them and it's like how many different ways across you know years can you actually like pitch this to people right and and try to keep keep things Fresh So for them it was very much like this creative bottleneck that they were trying to overcome from a business standpoint and while you were coming up with this idea are you trying to think so so the guy that writes Facebook ads he's kind of directly like linked to the money right people spend money on ads and make money from those ads right were you trying to think like okay who who is this most useful for we yeah so just to to set the context we thought this would reshape how every company operates entirely even from that early stage from the early stage because that compression of oh it can't really make any sense isn't it dumb to all of a sudden oh it can brainstorm instantaneously better than anyone else and when you look at what the trend lines are actually improving you had a reduced cost of computation m a decrease in latency so it could actually do this faster it could handle more context like you can give it more information as an input and it would follow those instructions um and then four as the models get bigger they get more accurate because they have more kind of knowledge that they can not retrieve out of it but it's it's just more accurate overall so when you project all those out and going oh okay this is like a year away from being totally transformational to business let's build for that like how what do we actually need to go do now to get ready for that stage so then so then you change the name for it like tagline you had all these different projects and then you settled on copy AI how did you how did you land on that all right we got two two ways that you do it one's like all right what are people actually doing with taglines and they're not just doing taglines they're doing like headers for their H1s H2S on their website they're using it for email subject lines they were using it a lot of different ways but Loosely all around the copyrighting category and you know this because you're asking people or you just see what they're doing yeah both you can just yeah see how people use the product and talk to your users and customers and so we're like okay that makes sense there is no copywriting app and if you look at copywriting formulas and principles so kind of like a set of instructions and they they're not too long so you could actually just give those instructions to the computer and have it start to Riff on those for you and so customers found that pretty valuable pretty useful so we just built us a like a whole series of Tools around copywriting and then we were looking for like copyrighting dumb ass this is my favorite part of starting this like just going and buying domains but copyrigh you know it's like copyrighting ninja.com and you're like whoa copy Pro or whatever I don't know like half most of the stuff's already taken anyway like copyrighting course.com you know I'm sure you you went through that I went through great PRS to grit yeah that's occupied your mind for like decades right like the name of it and my co-founder Chris he's he slacks me a message he's like hey check this out it's copy. aai I'm like that's freaking great I click on it and it's like uh you can pay $5,000 now or you can rent to own it for $180 a month and I was like buy I just instantly bought it like bought it or rent to own did the rent to own and then we bought it anyway but it was it was amazing I was like this is clearly it and what's nice about copy it's such a core way that people use computers is to copy something and paste something somewhere else and when we looked at the aggregate impact of of AI and generative AI on businesses a big part of it is just adopting best practices so in the current state of the world people write great blog post content This Is How We Do X this is why we do it you know but you can't actually translate that instantly to your business you have to hire someone they have to read it then they have to kind of figure out okay well how do we actually do it how do we actually configure that into the way we operate all of that is going to be get turned into an AI process and so in that world then you can then you could say hey look I want a worldclass sales operation copy and you just paste it into your your workspace or your account and that's how we're we're building our product now oh interesting that's way bigger of a deal than just like a piece of copy right like a very tactical snippet of text it might save me you know few minutes maybe once a couple weeks or a month you know yeah dud I I feel this all the time and one regret about changing the copyrighting course it used to be spelled with K's copywriting course with K's to CES is now it's literal it's like copywriting course so it's clearly a course about copyrighting like there's no there's no doubting when it was KS people were always like why is it spelled with a K and I always had a great answer and this has always been my belie since day one the answer was copyrighting to me is transferring information from my brain to your brain or my brain to a million brains and whichever medium does that the fastest I don't care whether it's text whether it's images whether it's video in the future whether it's VR in the future fature whether it's neuralink whatever weighs the fastest is what I want to convey so if I'm sending an email and it's just best represented with one image and one piece of text so be it I'm not going to like write a lot of copy I don't I'm not one of those people that's like the pen is the best way I'm just like I don't know sometimes an image is better sometimes a video is better than all of them and so that was the reason it's just like it was so much more than just like writing words on a page so and then when I made it C's copyrighting course I was like damn it Nots cool I know I know you want the meta version right because that's that's always a bigger picture well the main thing we have is copyrighting course community and when you spell those with KS you know a few years ago it didn't fly no it still doesn't fly I'm not sure fly still doesn't fly so so here's here's a question I was curious about you yeah your comp copy AI like just I think you had product Market fit it's safe to say right we had it kind of instantly yeah on Twitter yeah and I was always just like every by the way Twitter is like the ultimate copyrighting test how so like if you can't write a good tweet you're nothing's gonna happen oh that's a good way yeah I feel like I write more on Twitter now than I write like blog posts and I'm just like these are just short blog posts yeah but you were because I remember seeing it so like people were just like flocking to your service and I think it was almost hard for you to keep up with the demand which is like Mark Andre's definition of yeah we had we had really no idea what to do so just just like how many people were signing up on like a day or like what's a record something back then was like I mean right out of the gate when you launch obviously you're going to have a big spike right so we had two not everyone you did okay well we okay few okay few tips number one go if you're going to build something something or you want to be you want to start a company get on Twitter follow people that are doing that and they will inspire you to build something and launch so that's that's how it worked for us each time you launch something go like you need to first of all engage with people on Twitter that's very important they're humans and the people that you see engaging on it that's one out of like a thousand people who actually saw your post which is mindblowing like you it's almost impossible to imagine imagine that physically you're in an auditorium a thousand people are looking at you and then one guy is like replying MH right the scale of it's Way Beyond anything that that you can easily imagine and then once you do that you just start adding value to the conversations and as you do that people will start to follow you and then when you do these launches you just DM everybody that follows you hey we love you know your support we're launching this we're really excited about it that's it so that starts to build this little bit of a flywheel and feedback loop and then once when when you go the rapid MVP path like we did now we're launching all the time people are getting excited right so the by the time we launched the fifth thing we're just like doubling down on what worked with taglines we got like 2,000 people to sign up in the first two days so the real question for us was is this a blip or is there any value here and from a marketing standpoint you don't really know until you can see like okay is there any word of mouth component how like how do you actually go build that mhm acquisition engine at least to bring people in and so you know like 10 days later we were still getting like 250 signups a day organically which is great like that's awesome that's more than enough to start doing some experimentation that's paying customers no just people using the product you just want people to use the product and so for us that was that was like a moment okay we actually have something here this isn't just like a side Hustle but there is actually some value that's being generated from the platform and we have kind of dris some of the acquisition which is the biggest killer of startups is no one cares what you built yeah right also your your product was stunning at the time now now we have chat gbt and stuff like that it's kind of like it's hard to understand right but at the time I remember I do these office hours in our copyrighting course and we go through and I was like yeah check out this tool copy AI if you want to brainstorm headlines you just put what you want in there and this tool will make like 20 of the headlines and people were like wait wait wait wait what no one had ever seen something like that in history like in the history of humans people are just like wait what what just happened it's like a show stopper moment from that on the office hours would all be about like AI we still get people thinking that it's just looking up something on the Internet and copying it and putting it back in the window for the user I'm like no it's actually generating like what do you mean generated and that's you know it's not the easiest thing to explain to your average user so you had you had something that like people just never seen before they never seen it yeah and um the first generation where you didn't have the instruction following model yet you couldn't just tell it what you want you had to use a tool that's the tools don't quite fit like exactly what somebody wants you'd have to go browse a tool and figure out you know okay well is this is this like a paragraph generator like what am I what do I need actually needed which tool do I need to get the job done so I remember we had a conversation about SEO and I said our top stuff is generators and basically the generators was me working with the developer to like make like you know you put like verb yeah uh gender whatever and then like you put it it's it's all like manually done right so you make this generator but it's just a dumb piece of code following uh HTML and JavaScript yours your tools that you made were like AI creating the thing a new for you each time yeah and and like I know your SEO just like freaking we did Skyrock yeah we did we went the free tool route we we like made some of those free you're making free tools no one had ever seen nobody ever had before yeah yeah exactly yeah so and you're in well yeah but you're also in a little bit of a chicken or the egg problem because no one knows to search for it so it's hard to build an SEO tool that no one is even thinking about too you know like if you look at business name generator like Shopify was pretty pretty early on that and they owned a bunch of those HubSpot owned a bunch so so then so then copy AI I know at at its peak tool um it was like 75 different tools so the the original use case was like okay subject line generator and then to make a blog post generator or I remember you made like an ADA generator I would I use Ada formula with everyone and you made like Ada generator and but you have to like tool each one a little bit different it wasn't like an omni tool like it is and so you you just started adding tools after tools prompt engineer um you know a diverse set of ADA examples that don't cross conflict from a word or a theme like um basis so it's it's just a pattern recognizer so if your samples your examples like hey here examples if they're overly if they're patterned in different ways you want to eliminate that so it was it's a lot of so let me it's a lot of prompt engineering just to get something to be like pretty good and decent and that's interesting so whenever you're trying to make an Ada generator at least back in the back you were giving it just a bunch of ADA examples like high quality Ada examples so you were going across the internet cleaning them up for text entry sometimes writing them yeah sometimes writing oh man yeah so you there's a lot more work than a l more work okay so then you just keep kept adding and adding adding tool like I said I think you had 75 at the peak yeah and then guess what users complain about what I can't find the tool can't find the tool yeah t tools yeah classic classic classic right and then you're like well what if we create like a a search we could like search for the tool right and then it's like we're kind of back at square one you know at that point it's just not so then what were the most commonly used tools at that time during Peak Tool Time yeah big big ones were like paragraph generator because that could actually that was kind of the biggest block of text that you could do interesting and make have it work and so a lot of people would build like an outline and then hit that throw the outline as as the input and then actually generate like a high quality paragraph and then Instagram captions people ate that up because really yeah a lot of people have to write you know like an Instagram post every week or more every day sometimes for Brands and you know businesses I have a theory I mean obviously we do copyrighting so we see a lot of versions of it I'd say the thing that AI has mostly replaced and thank God because I hate doing it is supporting content and what I mean by that is let's say we upload this video to YouTube right now you got to write a description yeah now you got to write tags now oh oh God forbid you have to go and do those uh those tags like the time tags the time stamps that takes forever and instead the AI can just do it right away it's 85% good does it'll get better it'll it'll eventually be 95 100% good and so I feel like those types of like low-level things that you didn't want to do AI is just really good at yeah and it's so fast at yeah it gets in it gets kind of embedded into the whatever applications you're using yeah so okay so in terms of can I say one thing real quick it is fun to see like you know everybody's like oh hey I can't do this perfectly or they can't do that perfectly but then you look at like the job level that people do like a lot of times it's not great yeah you know and so what was actually cool is in when you're building tools you can get that feedback in real time if people find it valuable or helpful and you can kind of figure out what is the actual level that is helpful and useful it's very different levels for different users M and so as you can imagine professional copywriters they're like this isn't that great and then everybody else is like this is amazing it's just like that level of standard I think with copyrighting we think of okay this is going on the homepage of some high volume website and every word is like super critical to it but that's just like a very small percentage of total content and copy that needs to get created I would say that a very lucrative part of copyrighting was these midlevel people that needed to write midlevel copy to other midlevel positions like it it didn't have to be the best thing in the world it didn't have to be the most engaging they were just trying to write a memo to a company they were just trying to write like you said an Instagram caption for an oil change place in Milwaukee it didn't have to be the craziest thing in the world and so that's when people are like well it's not better human can still write better I'm like yeah but you don't understand how much people need this that like average people need this you're talking about Elite copywriting or entertainment like there's this whole world below that where now those people can just do it right yeah so so let's talk about copyrighter copywriters in my like especially like when I think of like old school copywriters seem to be like a salty Bunch sometimes and it's almost like this kind of like the computer vers the human thing did you ever encounter those people we didn't really sell a lot to copywriters really no because we looked at the I mean if you look at the market there were like 15,000 copyright and you're talking about AI Computing going to impact every business and everything that people do this is not like it's not even in the same Market really really no because if you look at all the 100x size the market outside of copyrighting even just in marketing alone copywriting is just one element right of a marketer's job they're having to write a lot of things anyway for the the people that are really good with words they make excellent prompt engine they understand how every single word impacts what the what the model is going to do so we have found value in you know copywriters internally for our company as these prompt Engineers but it it's funny if you follow like the Reddit copyrighting the and I know it's Reddit so there's going to be some of that but it's just like everything's about like AI will this be gone um is this taking our jobs what's what's your thought on that for like those types of copyrights I think it comes I think for every every person's job is like a kind of like a collection of tasks right and as computers get more powerful they can do more of those tasks your job evolves do other things I can't speak for copyrighting in general but I know a lot of agency like big agencies they just view everything as a cost center to them and so anything inside of that cost center that they feel like they can replicate without a customer complaining or a client complaining they're probably gonna do it overall I mean yeah I wish I don't know yeah it's kind of funny I have a I have a blog post drafted out called does everyone just become a plumber no that's the answer for that I can I can tell you the answer to that's no why do why do you say we'll have plumber robot but that's not that's not why exactly that's not why exactly um I think everybody is is going to become a Creator I think all all of these tools makes it so easy to get something going and so if you have an idea or you have a vision of of what you want the path to getting there is so much shorter and every single tool that comes out all the AI tools like oh I need a website it's like same day you have a website with an email account um and you to give you an example my daughter she's nine she's like Dad I want to like I want to shop I want to sell stuff online I'm like cool she has like she's a great painter like okay let's let's get this set up and I'm thinking man it's gonna take forever to do this I we open up we get on a name cheap I grab a domain she wants to call it artshop kids.com get the domain name it's like $6 mhm then we go to Shopify I I just use the app so on my phone it's like 60 bucks for a full year starter plan or whatever MH from the app you can take photos of the product and list it and put the pricing in there and in 26 minutes she has like you can go on this website she has her first item listed the store is live yeah it's in 26 minutes she's an entrepreneur now so the world's changed and I think you know education and schooling and none of that stuff is relevant at all YouTube's the most relevant but but even then like it's hard to get that 101 content through because everybody wants to Niche down into advanced more advanced topics but like at simplistic level do you have a phone do you know to like get the domain and go to Shopify if you know those three things did you know it only takes 26 minutes right time to value is really sh and then uh once I told her the site was live she's like she's like cool like how many people are on the website I was like nobody she's like we need to run some ads that's what she said right so now her brain is thinking how do I get people to go to it that's where like that's where her brain's going to be going and that's great yeah because in our era we'd be on day four and we're talking about like so what's a DNS now what what is a what's an SSL certificate it was bad man yeah how do how do you get a server like I was in the seventh grade I'm like I'm going to learn how to code cuz this is like 200 2000 and you had the the first tech big Tech wave came through I'm like Okay Computer Engineering that's the thing it's like cool I get a C++ book it's 700 Pages open the first page it starts talking about objects and modules and I'm like I don't know what this is and then if you wanted to build like your own server you need a patchy and there's like a whole thing it it was too much too much effort to do any of that so yeah and and I was using like Microsoft front page and Dream Weaver like build these we you know like websites and how do you style it all and Shopify is like hey look every everything's mostly the same we'll just give you like a template ready to go out of the box and you don't need to mess around with like the server the payment system like any of that stuff yeah it's all gone then you just focus on like okay well what's the business problem business problem is super interesting what's the product and then how do we go find people that need that like what pain point is that solving for people I was in a in college I was in a in like an investment entrepreneurial group yeah and there was 200 people in it it was me and one other guy and the other guy worked for his dad and I was the only one that had a business and the reason was I was reasonably technical right I knew how to use dreamer I knew how to use front page I could do basic HTML I knew enough about the web that I could actually make a web page which back then was very very difficult and you literally needed like a real server and you need to get like had like a a bank account to accept payments then like link it and all these processes took forever and so the cost to entry for an entrepreneurial kid was very high in fact per potentially completely impossible for most people I was just lucky and now you go to an entrepreneurial Club every single one of these kids has tried something they started in a Shopify store they started trying to like resell crap on eBay whatever they've all tried something because it's like all you need is a phone and it's the tools are there to do it and so I assume the next generation will just be like even this like this 26 minutes of startup time and like you having to pay for her $60 uh Shopify I assume all that will just be erased yeah in in the near future all the all those things that she had to do to get to that point that will be 26 seconds instead of 26 minutes not even so she's in phase one phase two she wants to list art of other kids and and as a parent I'm like man I know kids like they produce a lot of art that may not make it you know you know mean like that goes out to the trash can or something at some point there just so much art that they're creating like at school and things but she wanted to make it um you know affordable art and then I asked him like okay well like how much how much if you sold like your friend's painting for like 20 bucks like how much of that should go to you and she's like half she knew she knows like take rates you know and I didn't have to tell her what a take rate was she knew what it was and did she she has this in inct did she use AI in any of this process I did to write the product descriptions yeah oh yeah yeah cuz I was like there's a painting she's like oh like what's it called it was like looked like a sunset she's like it's called Sunset I'm like we gota we got to do better than that you know uh so yeah we had generate you know different things title like descript the descriptions are great title's great and I imagine what would happen like what we've already seen with but the the real the I guess the real created thing was the painting like that's what we've got we' got painting and we have somebody that did it and that's an original piece of art right that gets me down to like it it sounds like a lot of the basically I think whatever the economy especially in Tech is like doing things that other people can't do so it it might have been writing product descriptions it might have been making a headline for a painting that you had and now that that part is I don't want to say solved but damn near solved and probably will be in a very short amount of time it's like the actual important thing moves so it used to be being able to write a headline and enter it into WordPress was a valuable skill now you're like that's not that unique anymore and honestly the computer's just going to keep getting better and our brains will keep staying the same so what is the end create what's the process that you're trying to sell so like your daughter is trying to sell like her creative paintings yeah I don't know how how should people is there a way that people should rethink about it because a lot of people's jobs are going to be completely more in the next 5 10 years completely shorter than that yeah probably I'm saying 5 to 10 years based on my previous SC internet think for everybody you should like everybody should be using AI tools like and try to be as close to the Forefront of that it's really critical so let's talk about this so copy AI started off of all these little tools then combined into one big Mega Tool then one Mega Tool yeah one big Mega Tool yeah then um exactly one year ago one year ago in nine days from right now I think it was chat gpt's first birthday yeah chat GPT was released into the world which is arguably I mean by all definitions from the past 20 years a full AGI maybe not full AGI it's it's what we would have thought is like a complete artificial intelligence just a few years ago just just two years ago we would have been like this is clearly artificial two reasons why one was the the interaction was natural for the user so it's like time to value is zero seconds so that that experience was incredible the breadth of things that it could do was also incredible you ask it for like simple scripts of code to do some something like I was like Hey build a you know scraper code to go scrape a website and return like the header text it just spit it out formatted like paste it into I have like a repet account and paste it in there run it I'm like does this even work and then boom it just worked and I'm like okay we have solved a lot of problems here with this model it's like a very special moment yeah to be able to see that right it almost eliminated all the maybe not right away but now especially with gbt 4 and Beyond it's just like instead of saying like make a specific tool for an email generator you don't really need you don't need it at all you can do it to make it better you can always add tooling to be more specific because the the way that they train the the general purpose model isn't isn't that you know you know it's not that good for any given task but it's good for the average task it's good enough for the average task yeah so you just have this general purpose tool and it's the first thing that I've seen every Walk of Life use I showed my mom how to use it I've shown like older people in our community how to use it and it's just it's it's simple yeah and then um one of the most shocking ones to me was it was nothing different but it's just the way we could talk to it so on iOS you can enable the voice feature you just talk to chat gbt and responds back to you yeah and you just you you could modify what it tells you too you can tell it to stop and tell you to in a funnier way whatever and that's it's just so natural for people that this is the first time I'm seeing everyone just use AI just as out of the box just just like that I think the craziest part is how general purpose it is too I mean we're used to like companies making Innovations and getting it to that moment and then like that's the company that's going to own that Tech and in this case that's not the case at all it's like Google could you know Google's got a new model set of models coming out called Gemini those could be better and then instantly you're like oh chat gbd is the best oh wait Bard app or whatever you know whatever app you want to use for that suddenly that's the best and so I think you know we're again I think we're conditioned to one company owning stuff and in the back of my mind I'm always is like what Apple's going to win this they the hardware right and they can embed these models and Shrink them and put them on the phone and at that point you're not even communicating with the internet really you're just communicating through the phone that's been a bit surprising I remember with the when I was young in college and like on the Forefront of tech it seemed like the smaller companies were actually capturing a lot more of the value from than the bigger company bigger companies are slow and and offline and they're like retail's always going win right and smaller companies were like yeah we can sell shoes online it's not a big deal and they were just like it'll never work and then those companies just took over it seems what's happening now is big companies are moving really fast on this because all they got to do is tell the developers to implement a few little API calls and Bam you got AI integrated into your already existing product and those big companies already have the contracts they already have the customers they already solving a problem and now you insert Ai and it just does it way better it's almost like the big companies have captured Ed a a predominant amount of the value as far as I can tell is that what you're seeing Market capab yeah yeah for sure so where have you seen like smaller companies kind of sneak in here it's good question so in the you know in like the business world and in startups and Venture Capital you tend to have Cycles you have very definite cycles and usually when there's a new technology it takes about two years for like the big incumbent players to like actually ship something mhm and so when gbt 3 launch I kind of set a 2-year clock I'm like okay like this much this how much time we have to go build brand awareness and distribution that we're going to need right and then like you said okay once the model gets good enough they can just bolt it on as a feature right and and be on be about their merry way so we're now in the incumbents adding AI functionality as a Bolton to their products and the way that that's largely manifested is in some cases search their search functionality got a little bit better MH um and then the second one that's more apparent to the user is like these co-pilot additions where you can chat with information or chat with the system so uh you're talking about like like a law document or a contract you be like when does this Clause expire whatever yeah things like that and Microsoft already has like their package of you know AI co-pilot that they're going to be selling per user per month toward against all of their customer base right and and kind of bundling Enterprise kind of chat GPT against that now is that predictable yeah this like super predictable so when you're a startup and you're like all right where is the white space here in the in the um Tech World usually it's you have a new technology comes out everybody just bolts it on and then the question is well what if you built from the ground uh purpose built around the tech what could you enable and then how do you build something that no one else can compete with because their architecture is built for an a bygone era and so that's the approach we've taken mostly out of necessity again like you're not coming in with $2 trillion do market cap and you're like okay how do we add another I think $30 a month per user like across 100 million users that's a lot of money for Microsoft in pocket right well also if they if they Implement a little co-pilot where you can chat with your docs well they already have all your docs they've got they got all the company docs already so it just I I would rather wait long enough to just use that than move to a new company right right for for most yeah most businesses they would need a really compelling reason to move and so you then as a as a company as a Founder you need like a more compelling vision of the future right uh-huh and so the easiest thing to do and this is what I always encourage Founders to do is just say that the the big company and what they what they're going to do is just dumb right it's just dumb and usually bolting on the thing to the other thing that whole thing still doesn't make sense it's still like a broken process so there should if you think about docs and like we have all this information the way that the co-pilots are set up you as a user still have to like initiate and Trigger something to happen so when you take Thanksgiving off your AI took Thanksgiving off which is dumb right it's just dumb it doesn't even make sense when we talk about it that way I think it's it's very easy to get attach to the market idea oh Microsoft's big or Google's big but Google I mean they just faked the whole product demo right in a very public way mhm so they're not they're not in a good spot right now Microsoft they can coast probably for like three decades and be fine but even then they they have this you know this agreement in place with open AI they're they got in put in a an awkward spot with the turmoil there the board turmo turmoil right and because it's not it's not um like the underlying models haven't created modes yet for anybody where you can just pull them out rip and replace and plug andplay any of the models it's still uncertain who's going to win that race and that's a race to spend like 100 billion dollars which means startup is never really going to be playing in that anyway like the amount of capital needed to operate these GPU Farms it's too much so where we where we looked at we're like okay do I really want to bolt on a chat thing that is unlikely to get used that much because the use case of like chatting with a document for most people isn't isn't really that significant it's just like another kind of chat like a search use case it's not transformational the business so what we figured out was if you take the software person's using plus what they're trying to do with it can you operationalize that entire thing in inside of one automation workflow so can you do the entire process beginning to end and the answer that's yes so when you look at the things that people do inside these humanin the loop workflows a lot of it's getting like gathering information which you can either push into this process or you can generate a query like a search query to go query it and bring it in and then once you have that then you have like the business logic well what do we do with this information how are we going to transform it what should an output look like all of that stuff's just prompts so that's a set of instructions and then where's any to go so once we turn it into this like piece is it formatted correctly and let's push it out somewhere else M so that those flows now what's interesting about those flows you can replicate them across every company once you build the flow you do that process infinitely at a minuscule cost and it's infinitely scalable do you have any real world examples of like that implemented yeah so you can you can do it really for anything and marketing you got a lot of use cases SEO a lot of use cases um one example we we look at like content production from competitors or trending keywords and so what we do is we can just build these like build these tools that go scrape the the serp in real time and we can just trigger that periodically to run and then when new things pop up you can figure out what what are like what are the keywords that they're trying to Target for are those keywords valuable or not and you just build these this flow that says okay now let's go create our own content based on our own set of information that we've got that does satisfy that search intent and so you can actually replicate that entire process in a set of these flows interesting I mean this was that's one use case but it's really just data everything is just data some logic and then a place for that data to move to H yeah when you're saying SEO I was trying to think about it I was like what we we do with clients is you basically like take some of the top things that you you do a report so the AI can now do this stuff pull a report where we doing really well if you're number one you're already number one you don't need to do anything but if you're number five it's just like okay what's the difference between my article and the one the four above me you know what it is it's like what 4x or something in terms of clicks it's big yeah and that's a massive difference so if you're already up there it's like okay what am I missing and you can use tools like HRS and different yeah we do this if you're on like page two you want to move to page one that's a big and usually it's something like you're missing a couple of keywords and a section about it and now well guess what there's tools out there that could just create that instantly update that headline say updated 2023 whatever do that yeah and even and even like you've seen U the Google search console data it's like 10,000 of rows of information right well well let me let me ask you this question you're uniquely suited for it so let's say SEO okay so SEO was this game of like who could spend the most amount of time updating their content and not be it was it was such a boring thing I I don't even do it to this anymore because like the value of SEO is like a little bit declining in my opinion so okay but now everyone's got let's say this copy AI workflow that they could just push and it just constantly updates uh SEO right and so it's just this battle of the robots constantly doing it so there's still going to be like a few winners it's a little bit of a zero sum game in the search engine world there's only one top of the page sure and so it's going to be like a couple of it's going to be like HubSpot and some larger companies just fighting out basically for that number one result I'm going to be buried right so what can people do differently now that that's almost like a solved game I'd say it's not quite solved yet it is um that's the gamified version of SEO but but the the more valuable one is where you're bringing that new information to the table right and that's the that's one of the great things about you can take the podcast get the transcript chunk it out into topics generate articles on each of those topics based on the Pod this is something we do already we're doing this with with transcripts internally it works phenomenally well can you explain you have a transcript right let's say let's say this video what's gonna happen we'll do it we'll do it it just it literally say the input to this workflow is the entire text of the entire transcript and then then we built a prompt that extracts out different topics of it then we have a workflow that grabs the topic and that full transcript and starts it builds the outline for you then we're like okay let's take the outline and actually build the content builds the content it's accurate against the transcript so it's not going to make stuff up and then from there you're like okay great now we have the article let's generate the title from the article and then it does that each of those steps is like it could be a lot of steps in there there could be a lot of logic all that stuff is now contained so that you could just rinse and repeat this over and over again that's really I'm glad you gave me a real world example that really set it in concrete because I'll give you I'll I'll tell you like the way that customers want to use that a lot of times they'll have like sales calls or they'll have customer support calls where the C the you know user or the customer they have very they have questions around use cases or like how to get it to do something and somebody's answering those questions in real time right and actually get that to turn into content historically is like kind of hard you know you need a marketer they need to get on like a Content calendar whatever but all that information is actually contained in the transcript so you can just route it now into these content building workflows and it requires very minimal editing on top because all the information is in there um I really love the thing you said net new information that's that's absolutely critical yeah that's going to be what people are going to be searching for now that's what Google's tried to incentivize for with their e e formula yeah entertaining educational whatever it means Yeah well yeah right and then even for the the way that the entire internet works is it's a Content flywheel the entire internet's content fly you upload stuff right that puts it in into this big pool of information Google sifts all that through and allows you to retrieve what's relevant right in real time so over time they incentivize you to create more content and share more insights right with with SEO and driving traffic so that's the monetization model inside this content flywheel now you stuck a a kind of piece in between that massive index the Corpus of information and documents which is the large language model so now that all that content all that information's like compressed into this large language model and then you can deploy that compressed model everywhere in every business process and so in the old days you had to go look up something on the internet right learn about it and then come back and try to do a task now you can just embed the internet into the task process itself MH this was what I got probably the most excited about when we started in 2020 because this is G this accelerates like the entire content fly of the internet make makes it way easier for people to publish things so in this trans transcript world you could just have calls all day long and it's just spitting out content on the back end well and it's all new it's net new it's not like you're just regurgitating or spitting back out stuffff and what's happening is when we upload we're describing how the world Works to these models now right you're you're kind of taking snapshots of the way people interact we're uploading video we're uploading photos that is trying to you know that's information that these models need to understand how the world works and that's that's the the purpose of those models interesting yeah it's kind of funny as you're saying that it's like this is the net new this conversation is the thing of bouncing ideas figuring out stuff I'm personally learning from it but then after this I have to there's a whole thing going on of editors and stuff like that that send me the video I send it to my guys that's not the future I think we know we can kind of see the pieces coming together around just operationally what what needs to happen to make that you know way more streamlined so we record this and AI just runs with it it distributes it it cuts up all the clips it makes the clips interesting it gives a description for each clip where to click after the clip how to go the next one right now that's all kind of like under the support of a human ey right which is a lot of time and money and honestly jobs that are like not fun it's just not a good use of time like you're the best use of time would be just having conversations with people constantly that's been my thinking interesting so if if I'm running a company it's probably just having 16 customer calls a day just stack them up yeah and then I don't have to even think about where the information needs to go it all flows into the system the system has the rules about what types of information need to route to who on the team we're gonna have that system set up in the next like few weeks internally so like where does this all so you said like how people should get started with AI probably just using it all the time just trying to use it a bunch there yeah there are two things number one use it all the time number two you have to have a you have to like reenter yourself and really understand what you want to do personally that's something that people don't do enough of they don't really a lot of people aren't thinking right now they're on their they're just scrolling through the feed constantly right and that's not how we need to live our lives the feed I OD like ideally the feed just goes away it would just hang out that's to me that's a way better future than the feed gets more addictive because you have more content more opportunities in the neural net to match content that's going to resonate a part of your brain better I don't think that's a good idea so I sent you a present purpose of that present this a typewriter is for you to actually not be distracted by technology and like start to try to communicate your own thoughts to yourself MH like very consciously and I found that to be quite therapeutic I mean I just like smash out stuff all the time now on my typewriter and it's it's given me a much firmer foundation for like things that I want to do even my own thoughts like if you've had thoughts that other people aren't validating or aren't popular like you don't you don't just want to get rid of those you want to actually make make those very clear to yourself you know what it is and why MH and so I think you have to pair both of those together like if my daughter says well the AI can do it I don't need to learn anything right I don't think that that is going to end up you're not going to end up in a good spot right because the the pace of change would encourage that Viewpoint right like why should I learn anything if a computer is GNA learn how to do it that is that is a valid question right yeah yeah so to me that's a very that's it's a very core question we need to be discussing MH and I don't think it's a like for me personally I would just always I'd hedge that and say that's like no it's you still need to learn something but it's a question that I think would play into a lot of the uh cultural memes especially around like anti-work stuff like you've seen this Reddit subreddit Trend I'm like is this China That's pushing this narrative on Americans like I have no idea where this narrative comes from but it's toxic to your culture so I I'm wondering I'm on the lookout for any of these narratives that are very toxic the culture and hard work because I think I know at least for me I found a lot of value personally in hard work and accomplishing things and feeling like I'm learning I think that's important regardless of what computers can do so when I and when you have a vision of what you want let's say I want to get over here and a computer comes along it should just help me get there faster so this should be a tailwind and so if you feel like computers getting smarter faster whatever are a threat I would recommend you think about how to reposition what you want in such a way that it's a Tailwind for you it helps you get what you want well let's let's travel back 20 years or so I was graduating high school going to college um hundreds of thousands of people maybe Millions I don't know worked with newspapers like the newspaper got delivered every day and you read it like like you you physically read this thing that someone printed with with metal right onto ink and then a dude drove it to your house right at 5:30 in the morning right that was a real thing that's how everyone got their news in the world it is pretty cool it's like if you printed the internet it it is it is stunning that it actually worked yeah right and then it's just like at that time becoming like a journalist was like this really hard thing cuz people people are still to some degree typing on typewriters computers are already kind of the norm but like not really the internet at the moment and so every single job that I've seen has been impacted by the internet within 20 years right and now that we're mostly digital those changes are going to take place at a different clock speed probably faster probably half each time and it'll just get faster and faster and faster um so even if you are a plumber the way I've hired I hired a plumber to install a cool new Japanese toilet and where did I find him on the internet how did I meet him through a chat app PL has been doing really well I don't know if you've you paid the bill yet but they're not they're not cheap but but this is why I wrote a blog post draft called like does everyone become a plumber because in the end all the stuff we're doing with tech like I'm writing stuff for people it's just like at some point if this gets replaced by a computer could do it really well I should be doing something that a computer can't do I should be in that frame where a computer can't and right now computer can't really move this from here to there that well yeah at least not a general robot we're still a little bit away from robot no we're not that far at some point it'll be no we're not that far well well here's the thing my thesis is like short-term medium-term and long-term and at the point way how do I make how do I preserve myself how do I make money how do I how do I stay ahead of all this in the long run right I cannot I've tried unless we all bomb ourselves back to the Stone Age and then I'm dead before then we don't I don't see a world where we don't all become robots it's an interesting question but but I almost don't see any way that that doesn't happen and for us I think that seems scary but for but I try to position myself 50 years in the future as a robot and I look back on the barbaric times of of me me and Paul sitting in a room together having to breathe oxygen that's at the perfect level so we don't die you flew on a big metal bird over here to get so dumb yeah went through all it's like all these things oh um if I hit you in the it'll hurt you a robot will be like yeah hit me in the face all you want it doesn't matter it's no big it's fun no I'm not a big robot fan but but we all become robots eventually right like we are already partially robot is someone's watching this they are watching us on a robot we're being recorded by a robot this is a robot my phone has a robot I mean if your knee goes bad and you get an implant it's like metal that's pretty dope you know so I mean that's why that's why I think being robots would be we're already biomechanical in many ways yeah yeah so I don't think it would be better like again I think you need a you need a very concrete definition of what you want well what if what you value I I thought I've thought about this a lot too I'll give you an example you mentioned the plumbers and my my brain goes in a million different directions one of which is as people uh at least in the US have gotten wealthier the size of our houses have gotten bigger over time so I think in like 1950 the average size of the house was like 1,200 square feet now it's like 3,000 of of new ones and so I'm like okay if we get so incredibly wealthy from all this Ai and computation like how big is the house going to get you know and I'm like okay a 20,000 foot house and I'm like how many toilets is that you know so you're talking about the flamber slapping a job right I'm like if the house just continues to grow like at that same clip everybody's in a freaking Palace you've seen these houses right everybody is like on Zillow like browsing these insane houses mhm so we are wealthier we don't feel any better we probably even feel worse and so that's why it's really important for everybody like be very Mindful and conscious of okay even if we get this economic growth on paper is life better or not yeah I would argue for most people it doesn't seem like it's getting better for them their life's not getting better like the the phone becomes more addictive because the content amount of content's growing the algorithms get better but if you could but there is an argument that like if we're just aliens looking at humans and we were just objective about like what's better you'd say like are they having more happy experiences than sad experiences and for the most part like people aren't dying all over the streets yeah you know like we we we don't think like uh looking at a mountain causes you to die or something a good question I don't know I think time scales are different we're we're still biologically wired right and now we're introduced to phones that are 6 in from our face that are programmed to like get us to react in certain ways I don't think the human brain can even function against that I don't think there are enough blockers against that so I think that's an issue yeah I think I think long time frame I'm talking 100 years there's we're fully digital basically is is the way I see it digital species yeah now now you can always you could always do this thing where you time scale it's like oh the heat death of the universe everything's going to die in 10 billion years okay fine that's but that's so far away we do have current time frame problems first so I try to divide it into three different parts the the the very longterm let's say we become like all robots and we're all just somewhere in a server can I can I say something real quick yeah everybody's scenario mapping always maps to some movie yeah but that to me is like that's not the best thing well I think I think thinking about it in a hundred years is a hypothetical thing right I would't the like either it's like uh whatever um it's like the Matrix right like that's a very common one you know like just people mentally mapping to movies that were they're all very much like horror movies I feel like I don't I don't personally think they're all I think obviously if you have a movie you have to make it horror movie because it's not interesting if it's just all nice let ask you this like yeah you take let's say you and all your friends took the day off and you're all going to hang out together what are you doing going ATV going shoot some guns and hanging out chitchatting that's the [ __ ] future yeah and so so that's it's not the Matrix we we watch The Matrix but I do think that if look that day off I swear to you is the [ __ ] future and if you told people hey we don't need you to work anymore so you've got the day off like you know for a long time you're [ __ ] hang out we could do it well I think it's moving more and more towards that most of the people we know that's kind of their life right do they like it I think so yeah they [ __ ] love it so I I wouldn't worry too much about like they're not giving it up let's just say that yeah I wouldn't worry I wouldn't worry too much about like these overly pessimistic versions of the future I think the things that make us happy are are really straightforward I think probably mortality obviously an A+ problem for individuals right which I think we'll probably solve so okay so you have you you have kids uh what would what are you training them to do so that they would be best set up in their future what are the skills that that you're instilling uh entrepreneurship that's pretty key and at a younger age I think from what I could tell most successful people they did something before they graduated high school whether that was like newspaper like throw newspapers and old days building websites M selling candy something just get that brand brain working around how do I how do I take my resources and use that to help somebody else in a way that I get more resources back and just think start to think and get those gears moving because I don't know what what's happened in um like colleges for example but none of the people that taught any of the courses have ever created any businesses so like you're not ever going to learn anything from them at all and all that stuff that's old and chat gbt to me was a moment to go okay we don't need like half the universities anymore and so we just don't have those conversations outside of watching like Peter teal videos on YouTube like you know 10 years ago talking about this so like it's just a matter of time before that people actually act on that information and so right now for kids like you need you need to have like high moral and ethical standard standards period so that's something you cannot you know you have to educate and teach around that uh two is like curiosity that's really key three is physical activity gotta have physical activity America America needs physical activity um and then for like I said some some amount of Entrepreneurship but it's really that to me is like a classical like the newvo liberal arts education is just being well arounded and being interesting H interesting good points yeah thanks for doing this man thanks man appreciate it yeah
