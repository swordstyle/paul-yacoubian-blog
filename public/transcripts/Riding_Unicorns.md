[01:11] riding unicorns podcast we are delighted
[01:14] to have you on we definitely will not be
[01:16] able to cover everything that we'd like
[01:18] to discuss because there's so much that
[01:20] we want to dive into but maybe we could
[01:23] just start with a quick introduction to
[01:25] yourself and copy AI sure so I'm pal the
[01:29] founder and CEO of copy AI we started
[01:31] the company back in 2020 to to help
[01:34] distribute the value of gpt3 at that
[01:36] time to the whole world so we build a
[01:38] prummer product that helps people create
[01:40] marketing and sales copy and content
[01:42] we're now automating lots of these go to
[01:45] market workflows and who have built an
[01:47] Enterprise product that's really taking
[01:48] off right now it's fantastic um business
[01:51] you've raised money from incredible
[01:53] investors globally I have tons of
[01:55] questions on the business and we um you
[01:58] know look forward to getting into into
[02:00] all of that stuff and how you're grow so
[02:01] fast and what the future holds but tell
[02:03] us a bit about your career um before we
[02:05] get into all of that you've had quite a
[02:07] Vari career accounting hedge funds I
[02:10] think a bunch of other stuff but tell us
[02:12] about it in your own words and what led
[02:13] you to copy hour yeah sure I grew up in
[02:16] a family of entrepreneurs so my parents
[02:17] had like a retail business and so I grew
[02:19] up in that thinking about business from
[02:21] a very young age and got really excited
[02:24] about technology in the late 90s when I
[02:26] was in Middle School and my role model
[02:28] at that time was not Michael Jordan it
[02:30] was Bill Gates because he had invented
[02:32] Windows 95 which was crazy at that time
[02:35] so we got the internet like hype bug in
[02:38] the late 90s my dad started day trading
[02:40] stocks in the bull market back then and
[02:43] I started day trading stocks too I had
[02:44] no idea what I was doing so you ride the
[02:47] wave and then when that wave corrects it
[02:49] makes you really go okay well what
[02:51] what's actually going on what are the
[02:52] underlying economics what is accounting
[02:55] what is an actual balance sheet what
[02:57] does it tell you and I had no clue right
[02:59] so I went what started out as a an
[03:01] accountant at CPA got into the hedge
[03:03] fund business when the cloud stocks were
[03:06] really iping in the early 2010s and at
[03:09] that time everybody was short these
[03:11] stocks they were extremely highly valued
[03:13] but the growth what growth rates were
[03:15] off the charts and so the question I had
[03:17] to figure out was what is it about SAS
[03:19] as a business model that makes that
[03:21] allows companies to compound at high
[03:23] rates of growth for a very long time and
[03:25] what are what are the mechanisms of that
[03:27] growth what are the underlying levers
[03:29] that these companies use to drive that
[03:30] growth that's a long way of saying I
[03:33] wanted to build those foundational
[03:34] blocks before diving in and starting a
[03:37] company i' always had a lot of ideas and
[03:39] expressed those in like different
[03:41] experiments or different ways to test it
[03:42] but nothing really at the point where it
[03:45] could it could be like unicorn potential
[03:47] at least uh back then so before we
[03:49] started this I was in the Venture
[03:51] business so we were helping employees
[03:52] exercise their stock options and what we
[03:55] realized was there's a finite number of
[03:57] companies that are investable and to
[03:59] Source those Investments you just need a
[04:01] list of everybody that works at those
[04:02] companies and you could start to
[04:04] actually piece together a Bottoms Up
[04:06] view of the entire Market that you're
[04:09] trying to invest in so it's a very much
[04:11] a comprehensive view do we have full
[04:14] coverage it's all data driven uh and
[04:16] then it's all connected into the growth
[04:18] and go to market way to Source those
[04:20] Investments to create copy and messaging
[04:23] and content for that particular audience
[04:26] and we crushed that we did a really nice
[04:27] job we got both of those funds that we
[04:29] were investing in in the carried carried
[04:31] interest mode which means we repaid all
[04:33] the investment money back and we were
[04:36] then sharing in the upside with our
[04:37] limited partners so that that was great
[04:40] and in that lens you can I I love
[04:42] businesses I'm a you know a student of
[04:44] business models i' had seen several
[04:46] hundred as an accountant several hundred
[04:48] as a public market investor and then
[04:51] more like a thousand or 2,000 in the
[04:53] Venture business because it's pretty
[04:55] much everything that was series a and
[04:57] Beyond so once you see it all the
[05:00] pattern matching is off the charts and
[05:03] when you're going to go build a new
[05:04] business you're just picking and
[05:06] choosing like the best parts of every
[05:08] one of these models and that that is a a
[05:12] tried and true technique for kind of
[05:14] drisking your plan going into something
[05:16] new I've learned a lot in in the
[05:18] meantime and we'll get into that yeah
[05:20] and the I I mean the the VC fund that
[05:23] you were General partner in sounds like
[05:25] a VC fund that an entrepreneur would
[05:27] co-found right it's not like a typical
[05:29] ass management play oh for sure yeah for
[05:33] sure so these are these are some uh
[05:35] friends of mine when they started it
[05:37] they they were the first firm to
[05:38] actually have that strategy this is in
[05:40] 2012 and at the time I was at at at the
[05:43] hedge fund and I got the deck for this
[05:45] new fund and I was like I have no idea
[05:46] what any of this means they're talking
[05:49] about stock options and 409a valuations
[05:52] and how they're going to come in at a
[05:53] discount and how you'd get participating
[05:56] preferred like equi upside structures
[05:58] with it this downside protection I'm
[06:00] like I have no idea what any of this
[06:02] stuff means and it was fun to see that
[06:04] play out and then my career path go
[06:07] realign to that and say you know what
[06:09] actually they have found an opportunity
[06:11] and then there's a way to tighten up the
[06:13] diligent side tighten up the
[06:15] underwriting side and uh build you could
[06:18] what was interesting you could actually
[06:19] build
[06:20] Dynamic options pricing models which we
[06:23] had for every single private company
[06:25] which is fun fun task to do
[06:29] well we we have so many listeners of
[06:31] this podcast who are stock option
[06:33] holders and oh man probably split in
[06:36] their approach some of them probably
[06:37] think they're rich when in fact they may
[06:40] well not not end up being rich from them
[06:42] some probably treated as zero and it's
[06:44] all bonus if if it does come through but
[06:47] how can there's a bunch of complexities
[06:49] around selling stock options who can buy
[06:52] them who can sell them um who need what
[06:55] approvals do you need from who like how
[06:56] how did you make this work in practice
[06:58] uh I know there's not a podcast about
[07:00] this but this is I love this too it's
[07:02] really interesting to me so I'll give
[07:03] like maybe a quick overview of the
[07:05] typical situation so you want to join a
[07:08] startup this and these are us startups
[07:10] that we have two different types of
[07:13] option grants one's called an ISO and
[07:15] one's called NSO the iso is the most tax
[07:18] preferred so you if you're an employee
[07:20] of a US startup you will likely get ISO
[07:23] grants and when you join the company
[07:25] says okay here's some here's the option
[07:27] to buy this this amount of shares
[07:29] roughly it equates to this percentage of
[07:31] the company and because it's common
[07:33] stock and because these companies
[07:36] typically are not the the preferred
[07:38] holders value the company at a certain
[07:40] price but they only put so much money in
[07:42] so if the company's valued at 100
[07:44] million and they've invested 20 there's
[07:46] only $20 million of return that needs to
[07:48] get cleared before the common stock
[07:50] starts to be worth something so right
[07:52] away you can see the common stock is
[07:53] valuable but not anywhere near as
[07:55] valuable as the preferred stock when the
[07:57] company gets that option price and
[08:00] valued like value of that common stock
[08:02] it tends to be like 10 cents on the
[08:04] dollar to the preferred stock so it's
[08:07] like somebody saying hey here's $100,000
[08:09] worth of stock if you want to buy it you
[08:11] have to pay us 10,000 bucks that's a
[08:13] great deal so that's one piece of it now
[08:18] you have so many companies you're going
[08:20] to have like half that don't return that
[08:22] money and half the companies are just
[08:24] not going to it's not going to work out
[08:27] the other half you might get something
[08:28] and then you have this huge power law
[08:30] curve where the top 1% of companies are
[08:33] returning usually most of the money in
[08:36] Venture so the real question isn't are
[08:39] my options going to be worth something
[08:41] it's more hey is this
[08:43] company working out in a really big way
[08:47] right and so it tends to be that if you
[08:51] are a world class employee like this is
[08:54] where it gets uh there's a little bit of
[08:57] reflexivity in it if you're a world
[08:58] class employeee and you know it and this
[09:01] and you want to work for this company
[09:03] that's a great sign like that stock is
[09:05] probably going to be worth something if
[09:07] you are not a world class employee and
[09:09] this is your first job in the Venture
[09:11] and there's no reason you should have
[09:13] gotten the job and the questions they
[09:14] ask you are relatively simple and they
[09:17] hire you right away it's probably not
[09:18] going to be worth much money the whole
[09:21] game in venture has been talent you have
[09:23] to build Talent density you have to get
[09:25] the absolute best people on the planet
[09:27] because this is these are the hardest
[09:29] problems
[09:31] period and in order to solve them you
[09:34] need human Talent you need the best
[09:36] talent on the planet and so everything
[09:38] starts with talent and you can typically
[09:40] look at the companies and the quality of
[09:43] people as you interview and meet the
[09:45] people at the company you can assess
[09:47] does this does this company have a high
[09:49] Talent part or not and the best people
[09:52] unfortunately for new Founders the best
[09:54] people only work with people that they
[09:57] have the best like the world class
[10:00] Talent will only join companies where
[10:01] they're the best people they have ever
[10:03] worked with work and so you can't put up
[10:06] a job posting and get random people
[10:09] applying it's not going to work you're
[10:10] never going to build talent that way you
[10:12] have to go out you have to seek people
[10:14] out and you have to figure out how to
[10:16] tap into those those networks but really
[10:18] it just comes down to you need to be
[10:20] excellent and you're it's not just day
[10:22] one but you need to have a really fast
[10:25] trajectory like upward in in how good
[10:29] you you get as a founder and then how
[10:31] how great you can build a team around
[10:33] that like it has to be truly world class
[10:35] if it's not truly world class and you
[10:37] feel it in your bones I wouldn't
[10:40] necessarily go exercise a bunch of stock
[10:43] options yeah and we we're gonna we're
[10:45] GNA talk all about that you're obviously
[10:47] now in the talent acquisition game
[10:49] you're that's raising great great great
[10:52] investors and you're doing really well
[10:53] but just leading to that what were the
[10:56] things that led you to becoming a
[10:58] Founder like always wanted to be a
[11:00] Founder you always wanted to be a
[11:02] Founder okay yeah in my in my bones I
[11:04] mean my dad is like an immigrant to
[11:06] America so he moved to America built his
[11:08] own company did things was very
[11:10] entrepreneurial so I had that kind of as
[11:12] a very young kid in a lot of different
[11:14] ways so what were the factors that
[11:16] aligned and me 2020 was the
[11:18] time good question I done different like
[11:21] side project type startup things where I
[11:24] had some Viewpoint and would figure out
[11:26] try to test that pretty quickly and 2019
[11:29] late 2019 we got gpt2 that had come out
[11:32] and so I started using that to
[11:33] brainstorm and I was like man I can this
[11:35] is like a brainstorming accelerator
[11:38] because I can just type in some stuff
[11:40] some idea I have and let it auto
[11:42] complete and it's just hallucinating and
[11:43] making things up and it would take my
[11:45] idea way further than I even thought and
[11:48] so I was like man I feel like there's
[11:50] like a box and it's got gold in it and I
[11:53] I'm like lifting like the top cover off
[11:55] just a little bit is like using the
[11:57] model but there's like a whole pile gold
[11:59] underneath it and pandemic happens
[12:02] there's like a feedback loop there's
[12:03] always a feedback loop when the pandemic
[12:05] hit Twitter blew up because everybody's
[12:08] on Twitter all day long then people
[12:10] start to build things you start to get
[12:12] influenced you're like whoa he's
[12:13] building something they're building
[12:14] something like what am I building what
[12:16] are we launching so that was part of it
[12:18] the other part was we had we had started
[12:20] investing in employees own startups like
[12:23] people were leaving great companies to
[12:25] start their own so we started investing
[12:26] in those and when you see somebody go
[12:29] yeah I got an idea and did this at this
[12:31] company and I'm going to put this
[12:32] company together and you're like cool
[12:33] here's here's 10 grand I don't think I
[12:36] don't here like try to get it to work I
[12:40] hope I can help you out in any way
[12:43] possible but then six weeks later they
[12:45] have a team they have a product they
[12:47] have a new investment round like they
[12:49] have customers and you're like in six
[12:51] weeks there's a there's some thing that
[12:54] just jogs this [ __ ] out of you and you
[12:56] go well wait a second I can make a huge
[12:57] amount of progress and have these three
[13:00] three wheels to play off of each other
[13:02] to spin this kind of momentum flywheel
[13:04] number one is people and it's all sales
[13:07] all of this is sales can I sell someone
[13:10] to join me and build something when we
[13:12] have nothing that's a hard that's a hard
[13:15] sell It's A Hard Sell for technical
[13:17] Talent is why Founders usually co-found
[13:19] companies with friends doesn't always
[13:21] work out but it's like a decent place to
[13:24] be second one is will anybody use the
[13:26] product or can I get customers there's a
[13:28] lot of Hustle around that and then on on
[13:30] the investor side there's a lot of
[13:31] hustle as well so you have to deal with
[13:33] rejection constantly having a a mental
[13:37] framework of okay there a numbers game
[13:39] we're going to ask a 100 people every
[13:42] time we get rejected we're going to
[13:43] listen to what the rejection reason was
[13:45] and we're going to fix something either
[13:48] in in the way we're operating the
[13:49] business or we could disregard that you
[13:53] objection or we can change how we frame
[13:55] what we're doing and a lot of times when
[13:57] I work with Founders most they're
[13:59] they're on to something big but it's a
[14:01] little bit challenging for them to
[14:02] communicate and articulate that back and
[14:05] explain in a way that investors kind of
[14:07] mindset is built on why that's going to
[14:09] be big and so a lot of it's like just
[14:12] that initial kind of tweaking and then a
[14:13] little bit of that process that goes
[14:15] into it so once I've learned from other
[14:17] Founders oh yeah here's the process oh
[14:20] dude this is easy like what so I was
[14:24] what do we want to do what's the most
[14:25] ambitious thing the biggest thing we
[14:27] want to do if we the a vision really big
[14:31] what is that going to be and we just
[14:33] said hey look if if there was a way to
[14:35] grow companies and solve this
[14:36] distribution challenge of Distributing
[14:39] Innovative technology then we'd be as a
[14:42] whole Humanity we'd be able to innovate
[14:43] a lot faster because the the feedback
[14:46] loop would be way tighter between coming
[14:47] up with something new and getting it in
[14:49] people's hands so that's a massive
[14:52] problem it's a sales and marketing
[14:53] problem it's a distribution problem it's
[14:55] a growth problem in Silicon Valley the
[14:59] way you solve those problems and you
[15:00] just have to go hire the guy or girl
[15:03] that figured it out at some other
[15:05] company you have to hire them and
[15:08] literally pay them to work for you or
[15:11] else you will [ __ ] up so that was it you
[15:14] either recruited a person that knew the
[15:16] secret sauce or you didn't you just
[15:19] prayed that somebody else would figure
[15:21] it out and it's really hard to do that
[15:23] and so it's nice for a handful of
[15:25] companies that can go recruit those
[15:27] people like we are one of those
[15:28] companies is now recruiting those people
[15:30] which is great but it doesn't scale
[15:32] across the whole global economy and I
[15:34] don't like that I really hate that and
[15:36] so we're building these technology
[15:39] platform now so that once we get this
[15:41] thing that's working really well we can
[15:42] just copy it and paste it into customer
[15:46] accounts and say here you go here's
[15:48] something that's this is truly a
[15:49] world-class process you take that and
[15:52] and really run with it and make it your
[15:53] own inside of your own company but a lot
[15:55] of the buil like there are basically not
[15:58] enough
[15:59] building blocks that were big enough
[16:01] building blocks we have you have idees
[16:04] you have coding interfaces yeah you can
[16:06] take like a framework and adapt it but
[16:08] on the on the goto Market side you
[16:09] really didn't have anything like that
[16:11] you could buy some of the tools you
[16:12] could buy HubSpot or Salesforce but you
[16:15] could buy the best best-in-class
[16:17] software stack and not grow your
[16:20] business at
[16:21] all like cat Hall so there's something
[16:24] about the promise of all these tools and
[16:26] we're it's going to help you grow and
[16:27] all the ROI and then it just never
[16:29] showed up because the operator is the
[16:31] one that drives value through it
[16:33] historically if your user is
[16:36] unsophisticated or doesn't quite know
[16:38] exactly what they should do with it
[16:40] you're not going to get value out of the
[16:41] software that's now changing and so the
[16:43] software has a better consciousness of
[16:46] the data the business logic it has an
[16:48] idea of how you might grow your business
[16:51] and so what we're doing now is just
[16:52] building a platform that makes it easier
[16:53] to apply that to your business and so
[16:55] how do we get those insights all it's
[16:57] all data driven
[16:59] how do we take all of that and create
[17:01] it's l literally like basic marketing
[17:05] and sales campaigns that work right it's
[17:09] just the basics stuff yeah and Paul you
[17:12] mentioned having a big Vision so you
[17:15] knew you wanted to build something big
[17:16] and impactful but then you've also
[17:18] talked there about they not being a big
[17:20] enough building blocks to get started
[17:22] and so my question really is around
[17:25] automation agents AI they're all big now
[17:28] Buzz workor
[17:29] but they weren't when you started the
[17:30] company really and so how much of the
[17:35] mission has evolved and how much is it
[17:38] had to evolve us as what the what the
[17:40] first situation was and what is the
[17:44] responsibility it has not it has not
[17:46] changed it's not changed so you
[17:48] literally you had a vision and yeah
[17:51] right when right when gpt3 came out this
[17:53] July of 2020 I was just I went crazy I
[17:56] was just tweeting about this I have all
[17:57] the Tweet logs I was like gbd3 is a
[18:00] phase change of the internet and so the
[18:03] phase change is we've been uploading
[18:05] stuff to it constantly right it's a
[18:07] giant content flywheel so you upload
[18:09] stuff to it and then that attracts
[18:12] people to go use it and download it
[18:14] information from the internet and Google
[18:16] is sitting at the center of it because
[18:17] they organize it and then they
[18:19] incentivize you to upload more stuff so
[18:21] that you'll be found right even with
[18:23] like podcasts you're trying to be found
[18:25] in the algorithm so the bottleneck to
[18:28] that system system is that people only
[18:30] have so many hours of day to consume
[18:32] that information and
[18:34] content right we can't just I mean
[18:36] they're not more than 24 hours in a day
[18:38] and they're not more than eight billion
[18:40] people so the big Insight here was
[18:43] computers can now make sense of that
[18:45] content they can make sense of that
[18:46] information and so what's going to
[18:48] happen is an increasing share of the
[18:51] consumption of that is going to happen
[18:52] by computers and not people and then the
[18:55] flip side of that is it's going to be
[18:56] way easier to make content because
[18:58] because it was very hard to make content
[19:00] before you had to do everything manually
[19:02] there was really there were really no
[19:03] tools to doing that and definitely not
[19:06] good tools at doing that at scale so now
[19:08] you can start to abstract away and work
[19:10] at a more meta level and once you have
[19:12] that then you can take think about what
[19:15] happened we took the whole internet huge
[19:17] ass internet and compressed it into this
[19:21] tiny thing we can ping anytime we want
[19:25] to add a little sprinkle of intelligence
[19:28] into any process right how is that not
[19:32] going to end up in embedded into every
[19:34] business process we have as a company it
[19:36] is just fundamentally there's just's no
[19:38] chance that it doesn't so we had that
[19:41] that was a a long that's been the vision
[19:44] pretty much forever the real question is
[19:45] just timing like gpt3 not good enough to
[19:48] get there but it's showing you those
[19:50] initial use cases that's blowing people
[19:52] away right because we thought okay well
[19:54] all it can do is retrieve and copy and
[19:56] paste but it can't generate something
[19:58] net knew but it was doing that so that
[20:00] that was like a big insight and I was
[20:02] like well okay well what's the value of
[20:03] all words that could potentially be
[20:07] generated and I was like that's in the
[20:09] that's I don't know what's beyond a
[20:11] trillions I'm like it's a huge amount
[20:15] right so we people are still selling all
[20:18] of this way short in terms of the impact
[20:20] it's going to have we're still in like
[20:22] in one which is how do we integrate llms
[20:25] into our business processes and even
[20:28] though that's that's phase two of our
[20:29] business it's still phase one of how do
[20:31] you actually get an impact out of this
[20:34] and it's just going to take it's going
[20:35] to take a little bit of time people have
[20:37] to get really comfortable with it the
[20:39] models have to improve to a certain
[20:40] level where where you can you have trust
[20:42] in the performance of it the outputs the
[20:44] inputs how to work with it and it
[20:47] definitely requires a rewrite and a
[20:49] rethinking of uh Legacy software systems
[20:52] which were built for structured data
[20:54] structured data is unstructured data
[20:57] that we chopped off a lot of valuable
[20:59] information from in order to fit it into
[21:02] a table right so that think about it
[21:05] like that that there's no chance that
[21:07] that's going to stick around all the
[21:08] unstructured data is going to beat
[21:10] structured data because it doesn't have
[21:12] information loss attached to it so you
[21:14] have a lot of like pieces of the story
[21:16] that come into play and then I had
[21:18] another tweet which was like if you're
[21:20] building like a gpt3 app and a VC asks
[21:23] you why now I was like don't don't walk
[21:25] away
[21:26] run that's literally went into like beta
[21:30] the day
[21:32] before I just lost my mind I'm like this
[21:34] is clearly the future and it's pretty
[21:36] exciting to be early on it so tell us
[21:38] tell us why tell us tell us why VC
[21:41] shouldn't run from from copy I mean oh
[21:43] this is four years ago this is four
[21:45] years ago yeah just I see four years ago
[21:48] just to give some context to our
[21:51] listeners like VC's are skeptical about
[21:55] llm rappers thin layers thin use cases
[21:58] on top of llms which provides some light
[22:00] workflow tooling to users but could
[22:03] fundamentally be displaced or chewed up
[22:06] by the foundation model providers in the
[22:08] long run what is it that you guys are
[22:10] doing to mean you have a shot at being a
[22:14] huge winner in this space in in in the
[22:16] long run yeah I'd say the important
[22:18] thing is to sell your product to the
[22:20] market and not to VCS right the market
[22:24] will never ask you that question what
[22:26] the market is asking right now and this
[22:29] is this is SE sweep and down they're
[22:32] basically saying hey look AI is is here
[22:35] it's legit and as a company we're going
[22:39] to have to really transition the whole
[22:42] thing over to it this this is a very
[22:45] that's a very high anxiety moment for
[22:47] companies and people working right and
[22:50] so now okay we're g to you set the
[22:53] vision we're going to transition the
[22:54] whole thing great how do we do it
[22:59] what what are we going to do are we
[23:00] going to ask every employee to become an
[23:03] AI
[23:04] engineer and try to train everyone on
[23:07] systems thinking data model design
[23:11] prompt engineering is that even like
[23:14] that let's put that at the very base of
[23:17] options right the very base option is
[23:19] everyone has to become a full stack
[23:20] engineer in engineer these systems at
[23:23] the very top of this pyramid of let's
[23:26] call it effort right is there's a
[23:29] company that sells the entire system and
[23:34] I can just pay them money and they will
[23:37] install the entire
[23:39] system and they will solve my problem
[23:41] and I can just hand them millions of
[23:43] dollars and I get it
[23:45] tomorrow okay does that make sense yeah
[23:49] so if you're if you're the CEO which one
[23:51] are you gonna which one are you going to
[23:53] do yeah I I think it's exciting because
[23:56] we are entering that kind of application
[23:58] layer
[23:59] of AI I didn't answer his question yet
[24:02] about the rapper but so you have at the
[24:04] very top is I'm a CEO I buy it tomorrow
[24:09] and it's installed and I'm done with my
[24:11] AI roll
[24:13] out right so the journey up that that's
[24:16] a value Journey that you have to create
[24:18] as a business providing
[24:20] Solutions right so you could you could
[24:22] start at the bottom and say we're going
[24:23] to build a training company we're going
[24:24] to Train everybody on how to do all this
[24:26] [ __ ] right or you could say look our
[24:28] sites are actually how do we reduce the
[24:31] friction of adoption so how do we make
[24:34] the pl product the platform way easier
[24:36] how do we abstract away all this
[24:38] complexity around llm selection e
[24:42] evaluation prompt engineering all the
[24:45] different data providers that have to
[24:47] get orchestrated and brought in to make
[24:49] these workflow right we're talking about
[24:51] hundreds of them it's not an
[24:53] insignificant amount of engineering
[24:55] effort right we're not a huge company so
[24:57] you have to pick those battles and
[24:58] basically architect your road map so
[25:01] that you're able to get to that dream
[25:04] state where I can go to a CEO with
[25:06] confidence and say look we have a system
[25:09] we're working with your direct
[25:11] competitors they're buying this
[25:14] system all right this is the output this
[25:16] is the results they're getting this is
[25:18] the level of streamlining across the
[25:20] board right and this is the the kind of
[25:22] visibility you can get into your Market
[25:24] that you're
[25:25] targeting that level of product that's
[25:28] kind of like you got to set that Vision
[25:29] a little bit and then you got to go get
[25:31] there so where you going to start yeah
[25:32] you're going to put it you're going to
[25:33] bolt an llm into a workflow automation
[25:36] product right that's your starting point
[25:38] then the question is do you have the
[25:39] right path to getting there and
[25:41] delivering that system there are going
[25:42] to be companies that get there so our
[25:44] goal is to get there faster than
[25:45] everybody else so how do you get there
[25:47] you have the best team you have the best
[25:48] go to market you the best marketing team
[25:51] you get the best Legion you're building
[25:52] a category like you this is a time where
[25:55] you can build a category as a young
[25:56] company there are a lot of of way
[25:59] that are not technical Mo they get you
[26:02] there from a technical Moe standpoint
[26:04] every company is unique so every company
[26:07] is going to build their own data
[26:08] Foundation they're going to have data
[26:10] that makes their system work in a very
[26:12] specific way to them so that data is
[26:15] going to live in our platform that
[26:16] becomes a data mode and then the process
[26:18] is how you take that data and
[26:19] orchestrate it to execute the workloads
[26:22] that creates process mode as well so
[26:24] these this type of model has been done
[26:27] all the time service now did it
[26:29] Salesforce did it their platforms they
[26:31] are extremely sticky you cannot rip them
[26:33] out once you get a few of these
[26:34] workflows embedded in them and Paul I
[26:38] completely agree in the sense that the
[26:40] AI is just a tool it's a bit of
[26:43] infrastructure that you build into just
[26:46] a tool it's not just a tool it's beyond
[26:49] a tool it's so it's such of your product
[26:52] it's not the product if that I'm trying
[26:55] to be yeah it's it's a different
[26:57] positive
[26:58] I would say that it is
[27:00] a it was the missing ingredient right to
[27:03] the whole data all of all the data all
[27:08] the it's product critical but it's just
[27:11] one part of the product it's a critical
[27:14] part obviously but if we and and then
[27:17] you've just talked there about how
[27:20] everything else your own approach your
[27:22] own execution your own product your own
[27:24] sales everything leads to success
[27:29] I think the question we have as VCS and
[27:33] what we'd love to understand more of is
[27:36] that you can go and build a really great
[27:39] business doing what you're doing because
[27:41] of all of the things you've just talked
[27:43] about great execution great product
[27:44] great talent right plus AI but will we
[27:49] have like Winner Takes all companies
[27:53] when the barrier to entry becomes a
[27:56] little a little lower or we all start to
[27:59] use these tools I mean what what do you
[28:01] think about that as a former VC now
[28:04] founder of an AI company what the alarm
[28:06] bells are going off in some VC funds
[28:09] quarters because they're like I don't
[28:11] know what's defensible and they don't
[28:12] actually know you obviously think it is
[28:15] very defensible and rightly think I'd
[28:17] love to hear your pitch on that as like
[28:20] how do you become a winner takes all
[28:23] when you are using this AI
[28:25] infrastructure to build incredibly
[28:27] powerful products
[28:28] yeah the winner takes all effect the the
[28:31] first place it will position itself as
[28:33] inside of one business and the way that
[28:36] LMS work the more data you give it the
[28:38] better the performance gets so that
[28:40] means that there is a natural
[28:41] consolidation force and an aggregation
[28:44] Force for every company every company
[28:46] will have to have all their data in one
[28:48] place right now there's nowhere for that
[28:50] data to go and there's no easy way to
[28:53] take that data and drive action from it
[28:56] so you have there will be a plat form in
[28:58] every company so that's like a starting
[29:00] point view on how this category is going
[29:02] to shape out in terms of how you win you
[29:05] need to win uh you need to land
[29:08] companies quickly and then you need to
[29:11] have that strategic conversation with
[29:12] them about their road map and just align
[29:15] the way that they're going to roll these
[29:16] use cases out internally to your product
[29:19] platform so that's how you win an
[29:21] account then how you win a whole lot of
[29:24] accounts is you just Blitz create and
[29:29] just there's no shortcut you just have
[29:31] to [ __ ] win it I think you try to
[29:33] find I always try to find places where
[29:35] there there's not a lot of direct
[29:37] incumbent like edgo Edge competition and
[29:41] you can kind of like slip in and do that
[29:43] this this is one of the few I think
[29:44] places where that that is the case I
[29:47] think it's a lot harder in many of the
[29:49] other categories that I think have
[29:51] demanded a lot of investment dollars I
[29:54] think it's I don't think I don't
[29:56] actually think that U first of all I
[29:57] think think the moat here is massive
[29:59] like way bigger than people realize you
[30:01] can't rip out core foundational business
[30:05] processes right that's and it's never
[30:06] been possible before the things that get
[30:08] ripped out are humanin thee Loop tools
[30:11] so if you have a business process
[30:14] workflow and you're saying hey we're
[30:16] gonna help James do his this particular
[30:18] task better but you could swap in any
[30:21] tool onto that task that's that's easy
[30:23] to rip out that's like saying okay well
[30:25] I'm not g use Chad GPT this week I'm use
[30:27] Claude
[30:28] well how how what's the Moe L the Moe is
[30:32] you've been programmed to type in chat
[30:35] GPT in your browser and you might have a
[30:37] a oneclick button right that gets you
[30:39] going that's the Moe that keeps you back
[30:41] in the business side all of this data is
[30:44] coming in to one system when we abstract
[30:48] away the llm complexity you end up with
[30:51] actions these actions are like
[30:53] independent applications there is logic
[30:56] that we own that in the back end that
[30:59] customers don't have any clue what's
[31:01] going on and there's no reason that they
[31:03] should because that is a platform that's
[31:06] a platform IP piece that we bring to the
[31:08] table and we solve this problem for them
[31:11] so when you start yeah yeah how have you
[31:13] seen your the performance of your
[31:15] product improve over time because I
[31:17] think the the the moat debate and the
[31:20] win it takes all debate two two separate
[31:21] debates right definitely super sticky
[31:24] but very curious to hear how fine-tuning
[31:26] models company data are there are there
[31:29] shared learnings are you allowed to use
[31:30] one company's data to improve the next
[31:32] companies is that benchmarking that you
[31:34] can do across your user base how how are
[31:36] you building any of those sort of
[31:38] network effects into your product yeah
[31:41] it's a good question we have core
[31:42] platform actions that are valuable
[31:45] across companies and we own that and we
[31:47] don't we're not using their data to fine
[31:49] tune on that but we use the data to
[31:51] understand analytics on is this working
[31:52] is it is is the is our core platform
[31:55] action improving or not uh when you St
[31:58] those things away you start to get
[32:00] platform effects at that level the other
[32:02] thing is use cases a lot of
[32:04] companies really need more opinionated
[32:08] guidance on what use cases to start with
[32:11] which ones to go after they're not doing
[32:13] this fulltime right there're this is
[32:15] their first go around of doing Ai
[32:17] implementations and really rethinking
[32:19] their business workflows and so we come
[32:22] with we come prepared with that as a
[32:23] company that's that's a very valuable
[32:26] piece to this we didn't always have this
[32:28] I like being opinionated I don't know if
[32:30] you guys can tell but a lot of firm a
[32:32] lot of companies don't want to be
[32:33] opinionated they say here's the tools
[32:35] here's the keys like go go wild and what
[32:39] we've seen is probably nine to nine and
[32:42] a half times out of 10 people will use
[32:45] the the tooling to basically go build
[32:48] the human in the loop task
[32:51] accelerator right they're not systems
[32:53] thinking because that's not been their
[32:54] problem their problem has been getting a
[32:56] particular job done and as a result if
[32:59] you ask them what do you want they'll
[33:01] tell you I want the faster horse right
[33:04] they won't they won't articulate or
[33:07] invent the car they've never had
[33:09] experience doing that they've never
[33:10] thought about the Inn system they've
[33:11] thought about their role in these
[33:13] business
[33:14] processes then the other issue is torg
[33:17] they've not ever built go to market use
[33:19] cases they're very much building
[33:21] infrastructure maybe business logic we
[33:24] routing back office stuff but nothing
[33:26] front office side for the go to market
[33:28] team so you're in this position where
[33:30] the market will get developed over time
[33:32] but it's really like very hungry for
[33:36] more of a full service more full full
[33:38] stack approach to what their own road
[33:41] map should be That's Unique I I you
[33:44] don't see that very often most of the
[33:45] time it's okay here's the tool like this
[33:47] is how Dropbox uses it and you just walk
[33:49] away and you say hey here's a Dropbox
[33:51] case study well guess what Dropbox had
[33:54] an awesome team and if they're only
[33:56] getting it 15%
[33:58] like lift in some key metric the average
[34:01] user is not getting [ __ ] like they're
[34:03] wasting their time and money on the tool
[34:06] right because of the user sophistication
[34:08] problem so for us we got to solve that
[34:11] thing we got to bring we got to bring
[34:12] more to the table for
[34:15] companies and Paul when we look at an
[34:19] infrastructure player like open AI they
[34:22] OB they obviously have some of their own
[34:24] applications
[34:26] EG yeah
[34:28] where do you think the lines stop or
[34:30] like the
[34:31] strategies stop are they are they going
[34:34] to develop more of their own
[34:36] applications or do you think that they
[34:38] will accept a position as an
[34:40] infrastructure player and chat GPT as
[34:43] just trying to show the world what it
[34:45] can do to encourage people to then come
[34:47] and build businesses on top and is it as
[34:51] simple to bucket companies or Tech into
[34:55] infra versus app what's your view on
[34:58] that because I think everyone's trying
[35:00] to build an opinion of that well you
[35:02] just ask customers what what do they
[35:04] want so if you ask Enterprises they said
[35:07] like seven out of 10 want to move
[35:09] everything to open source models like by
[35:11] the end of next year and when you ask
[35:14] Enterprises well how do you feel about
[35:16] open AI they're like well we don't want
[35:17] to be stuck on one provider and so when
[35:20] you start out and you're known as being
[35:22] the one model provider you are really
[35:25] stuck from being able to offer a full
[35:27] Suite of cloud services around that and
[35:30] so they haven't done that they' they've
[35:32] gone the other route which is okay we
[35:34] tried the a the API thing I think when
[35:37] they first launched it in 2021 we were
[35:40] 14% of their revenue that year which is
[35:42] pretty fun like a couple of the apps
[35:44] were doing more Revenue than open a was
[35:47] and I think they saw that and went okay
[35:48] well there's a race to the bottom on
[35:50] llms in terms of cost right let's go
[35:54] build an app and go make some money and
[35:56] then we'll figure out how to sell that
[35:57] so they've been doing that they've been
[35:58] doing good job with that building their
[36:00] distribution Partnerships building more
[36:03] consumer prosumer type products they're
[36:05] going to have Enterprise Products that's
[36:07] that everybody else will and you still
[36:09] have to win win trust win loyalty figure
[36:12] out distribution so I've always treated
[36:14] them more like another Microsoft another
[36:17] Google another Amazon uh we work really
[36:21] closely with their the early team there
[36:23] they're some of the best yeah best
[36:26] people good people right people and so I
[36:29] I just I don't ever worry about what
[36:31] they're doing at all we have a we have a
[36:35] pretty Clear Vision has not changed
[36:39] right and they're there if anything
[36:40] they've only helped us get there faster
[36:42] with with the kind of Innovations
[36:44] they've had on the llm side and now you
[36:46] have other you have other providers
[36:47] you've got anthropic that is as good or
[36:50] better for many of these cases you've
[36:52] got M you've got meta now contributing
[36:55] llama as an open source model which
[36:58] Rivals both right so it is a as a wedge
[37:02] into the market the LMS they put a lot
[37:05] of pieces in motion with the work that
[37:07] they did and now if you're like
[37:08] anthropic you might have the best model
[37:11] maybe a better product and then it's
[37:12] still it's still hard to compete against
[37:14] open AI so we try to just say look this
[37:16] is a piece of the whole solution and
[37:19] it's is it winner take all like you
[37:22] would have thought Cloud would be a
[37:23] winner take all instead you have an
[37:25] oligopoly and what ended up happening
[37:27] was when they got down to three players
[37:30] they had I don't know if you guys saw
[37:31] this chart I saw it I think yesterday on
[37:34] on X and I was like oh [ __ ] this is it
[37:36] it was basically the price drop for AWS
[37:41] Azure and Google Cloud on a price per
[37:44] gigabyte per month of Hosting was
[37:47] falling off a [ __ ] cliff and then in
[37:49] 2016 it flatlined magically it has not
[37:53] moved and then all of a sudden these
[37:55] things become cash counts for every
[37:58] and I think with the llms there's
[38:00] probably a moment where they get you
[38:02] know they just get so cheap that and you
[38:05] have this explosion of use cases around
[38:07] it what's what's tricky right now is the
[38:11] prices are falling faster than companies
[38:14] can figure out how to scale volume in
[38:15] consumption right because it's not to
[38:18] build the systems that consume is
[38:22] non-trivial that's the problem that
[38:23] we're trying to help companies with
[38:25] right building a platform that right
[38:28] we're still so early with the
[38:29] application you mean you're so early the
[38:32] fact that you started four years ago and
[38:35] we've only had a handful of application
[38:38] layer AI
[38:40] companies yeah I mean look the the
[38:43] simplest application is I ask it to do
[38:46] one type of use case and it gives me a
[38:48] response right that's an app and then
[38:51] the more complex one is okay well how do
[38:52] we how do we solve a really big hairy
[38:56] problem where there's a lot of orchest
[38:57] ation a lot of data that has to come
[38:59] together and then the output quality has
[39:01] to be at such a high bar that it
[39:03] actually does Drive business value this
[39:06] is not trivial it's not trivial [ __ ] to
[39:08] do for one company and it's it's much
[39:11] harder to scale that across different
[39:13] companies and then to build the system
[39:15] where it's you're driving the flywheel
[39:17] effect which is what we go after we
[39:19] don't care about funnels we care about
[39:20] flywheel effects to to build it where it
[39:23] goes after the flywheel effect you want
[39:25] to preconfig the whole thing and the
[39:28] next phase for us is once once we have
[39:31] the data Foundation which we'll be
[39:33] releasing later this year alongside the
[39:35] workflow automation piece then you can
[39:38] hand the keys over to the llm and say
[39:40] hey what should we what else could we do
[39:42] make some
[39:43] recommendations and at that point you're
[39:45] not going to be B bottleneck by people
[39:47] like thinking about this [ __ ] coding it
[39:49] up testing it the system will do that so
[39:52] once you have the system doing it you
[39:53] will have released the last major
[39:56] bottleneck which is engineering of
[39:58] workflow
[40:00] process and at that point then then it's
[40:03] okay now we got to gate and figure out
[40:05] well how do we how do we test and put
[40:07] some kind of guard rails and controls on
[40:09] that but then at another Point once it
[40:11] figures the [ __ ] out it's just going to
[40:13] go and then once it goes you're gonna
[40:15] that's like a real scoped autonomous
[40:19] system but for for very specific
[40:22] workflows which are the growth
[40:24] workflows fascinating pool and we could
[40:27] again it's another topic we could have a
[40:29] whole podcast around but we have to pack
[40:31] everything into a short space
[40:32] unfortunately but I give you an you an
[40:34] example of one I'm testing a product
[40:38] skew for VCS called the AI associate
[40:42] okay and so think about it this way you
[40:45] have let's say you identify a company
[40:46] you're interested in and you want to get
[40:48] in front of the of the founder what do
[40:50] you typically
[40:52] do you're going to send me a message
[40:54] what's the message GNA say good to hear
[40:56] about what you bu
[40:57] I've played with your product I think
[40:59] it's
[41:00] awesome can we can we set
[41:03] up something like that does that work
[41:06] 100% of the
[41:09] time keep it short keep it sweet it's
[41:12] good to hear about what you're building
[41:13] okay well you don't need my help then
[41:15] okay let's say you invest in that
[41:16] company
[41:17] right and you're like hey we want to add
[41:20] value how do you add value to them I say
[41:23] who are your top three Target customers
[41:25] right now uhhuh and then see if is there
[41:28] someone in my network who knows them
[41:30] what role are you hiring for at the
[41:32] moment are there any other VCS you need
[41:33] to speak to add me on Whatsapp you can
[41:36] ask me to any anything at any time
[41:39] whatever it might be yeah yeah so
[41:41] exactly so what you can do if you ask an
[41:44] llm you say hey here's the company right
[41:46] I'm trying to help them out the lm's
[41:47] gonna ask you well who do you know and
[41:49] you're like well I know these 4,000
[41:52] people it would just review all 4,000
[41:55] and make recommendations on who be a
[41:57] good fit for that person to know and
[41:59] it's not across one thing most most
[42:02] Founders have multiple problems they're
[42:04] trying to hire they're trying to find
[42:05] customers and they're trying to raise
[42:07] money typically those three things right
[42:10] I don't know if you guys have ever had
[42:12] uh your memory jogged when you're
[42:13] looking through who you know go oh I
[42:15] should introduce them with so and right
[42:18] this is a data over we have data
[42:19] overload we know too many people there
[42:21] are way too many Miss opportunities
[42:23] because we don't we don't have the
[42:25] capacity to mentally scan through Rod X
[42:27] of 3,000 people every time we meet
[42:30] somebody new and so that's that's a good
[42:33] that's a good use case for AI 100% And
[42:35] and I think the I mean CRM enrichment is
[42:38] one piece of it you you need a lot of
[42:40] layers of context to be able to do good
[42:41] matching and it's something that we
[42:43] think about and we'll build we have phds
[42:45] Engineers on our team so it's it's
[42:47] something that we're working on it's a
[42:48] big unsolved problem and it's a good
[42:50] problem to to well I'm building in a way
[42:52] where I can I can copy and paste it
[42:55] across every VC so think about it the
[42:58] VC they know everybody they have the
[43:01] biggest Network like out of the box you
[43:04] should be able to add a million dollars
[43:06] of AR to every company that you meet
[43:09] with whether you're invested in them or
[43:11] not it's just my personal belief and I
[43:15] think once you once you can reliably add
[43:17] that value to companies everybody will
[43:20] want to work with you and not only that
[43:21] the companies you invest are going to
[43:22] grow much faster we're just blocked
[43:25] there's not there are too many people
[43:27] and too many opportunities and we don't
[43:29] have a systematic way of driving that
[43:31] yeah Paul I think it so tell us how are
[43:34] you doing it for your angel
[43:37] portfolio I just have good
[43:40] taste nothing fancy I'm like that [ __ ]
[43:43] exists and somebody builds it I'm like
[43:46] they're the ones basically I get a lot
[43:48] of signal just around what somebody
[43:51] built the fact that they built something
[43:53] to solve a specific problem that's a
[43:56] quick win for me and then thinking about
[43:58] how ambitious is that vision and are
[44:00] they just pumped the [ __ ] up about it
[44:03] are they excited about it because I know
[44:05] how hard it is to sell people to join
[44:07] you and raise money and sell customers
[44:09] and if you're not bring in the fire in
[44:13] every call you don't got it man it's an
[44:16] energy game and so I just look for that
[44:18] I look for that and then I I like again
[44:20] anyone that's just got a pretty
[44:22] ambitious Vision I feel and they have a
[44:24] good head on their shoulders to take put
[44:27] that's the other thing yeah definitely
[44:29] think we're looking for and you've
[44:31] certainly managed to pick some companies
[44:34] with big visions of mercury and Adil and
[44:37] others so oh man I was yeah I was early
[44:40] customer of of mercury andal I I had
[44:44] literally had that that was one of our
[44:45] ideas that we' had we had an idea for a
[44:47] company called robot tanle which was
[44:50] andril but basic but basically for
[44:53] consumers with there were high net worth
[44:57] right cuz it was about civilian defense
[45:00] systems right we're all very much
[45:02] subject to like how good our government
[45:04] is at protecting us but what we've seen
[45:07] across the board you see this in Ukraine
[45:09] is the the citizens were really not
[45:11] protected whatsoever and I'm like man
[45:13] somebody should sell civilian defense
[45:15] systems that are essentially at the same
[45:18] grade as the military ones and I was
[45:20] like it would be drones you'll have
[45:22] drones you'll have oh man what was it
[45:24] emps like literally you can't drone me
[45:27] if I EMP your [ __ ] out of the air right
[45:30] and then it got into well why do we need
[45:32] government at all well we need Municipal
[45:34] Services we need fresh water we need
[45:36] sewage work done I'm like I can build a
[45:39] rig like a literally an intermodal car
[45:44] and fill it with industrial equipment
[45:46] that does all of those functions and the
[45:48] total cost was like 40
[45:50] grand for all of it I could have solar
[45:53] panels
[45:55] starlink compost ing
[45:58] toilets and like water water
[46:00] purification and storage systems all in
[46:02] one box and I was like if we had that we
[46:05] would literally we could live off the
[46:07] grid at our house we wouldn't need the
[46:10] municipal system at all I want to I want
[46:12] to see but I don't want to live in the
[46:15] world that you envisage it's it's better
[46:17] than this one all right this one's great
[46:20] I love this this world's like this
[46:22] world's awesome I don't I don't ever
[46:24] want to put down this world but it's
[46:26] just like these little things where
[46:28] something is very cheap that does the
[46:31] job and it takes away a lot of
[46:33] bureaucracy and slowness that we hate
[46:36] and it just makes it makes life more
[46:39] enjoyable my my ring doorbell feels like
[46:42] an insufficient defense mechanism now
[46:44] but it's all I've got ring was oh man
[46:46] ring was close my friend built a a cell
[46:50] phone tracker basically would pick up
[46:53] the cell phone ID and installed it at
[46:56] its door
[46:57] he worked for the FBI but anyway he
[46:58] installed at his door his house got
[47:00] broken into and he was able to trace the
[47:03] phone and and got the
[47:05] guy wow and what they did is they Apple
[47:09] only because they his phone right Apple
[47:12] ended up Banning that type of uh thing
[47:16] and so now they rotate the ideas IDs out
[47:20] so like our National Security Agency
[47:22] they can they track everything anyway so
[47:24] they know where all the phones are but
[47:26] he built it for his own his own self and
[47:28] then it paid off I was like dude yes I
[47:31] was like there's so
[47:34] many we got a lot of crime at least in
[47:36] the US that
[47:40] is uh no it's not they stole other stuff
[47:43] from his house but he he caught him
[47:45] because their phone was connecting to
[47:47] his his like Honeypot device right okay
[47:52] yeah I was like that's that is awesome
[47:55] that's awesome it's amazing there's
[47:58] still so many problems in the world that
[48:00] this this industry is going to look to
[48:01] try and fix well we got yeah we gotta
[48:04] solve all the ones the governments are
[48:06] creating right now for us unfortunately
[48:08] so Paul we've we've covered a lot of
[48:10] ground we've just got our final two
[48:12] questions so the first is a future
[48:13] unicorn prediction and then the second
[48:16] is our dinner party guest game so if you
[48:18] could have three oh my gosh our future
[48:21] unicorn so I'd have to give and it's
[48:23] other than copy other than our company
[48:27] I think taco t a KO so they are the ined
[48:31] in perplexity so if you like search in
[48:34] perplexity for betting market results or
[48:36] stock charts they're the ined that pops
[48:38] up and what they're doing is they're
[48:40] taking all the data that exists in
[48:43] private apis and they're rendering it in
[48:45] real time to answer these queries and
[48:48] actually build insights off that so that
[48:51] is something that's going to get
[48:52] embedded not only to every AI product
[48:55] but that API where it's a universal
[48:57] layer to access premium data that is
[49:00] going to be incredibly valuable for any
[49:03] kind of workflow that is running through
[49:05] AI agents I think most people now are
[49:06] going to be or a lot of companies are
[49:08] going to be thinking about what is our
[49:10] data strategy to monetize all this great
[49:13] information we have uh I think that is
[49:16] probably that's such a powerful spot to
[49:19] be in as an aggregator of kind of that
[49:21] really valuable Rich information so I'd
[49:23] have to give I gota give my buddy Alex
[49:26] shout out for
[49:28] that awesome very cool and I feel like
[49:31] perplexity is really getting used more
[49:34] and more and more by people get picks up
[49:38] more perplexity is already a unicorn
[49:40] that would have been that would have
[49:42] been one of my other
[49:44] ones cool I'll just do the last question
[49:47] then Paul uh dinner party guest game
[49:49] three dinner party guests all right
[49:51] we're going to go with I'm going to go
[49:53] with Peter teal I'm going to go with
[49:56] dougas Murray and I'm gonna go with
[49:59] Arnold chis Egger yeah that's awesome
[50:02] we've had Ary
[50:04] before but I'm can't remember who so
[50:08] Douglas Murray's he's like a actor right
[50:12] no he's
[50:13] a oh sorry he's a big yeah he's an
[50:17] author he's like a kind of he's a Brit
[50:21] and he's a kind of social commentary
[50:24] quite a bit yeah and it's make for a
[50:27] good dinner conversation and he really
[50:29] doesn't have nothing's really off off
[50:32] topic for him he he's the inspiration
[50:35] some behind some of your um sort of uh
[50:40] healthy critical analysis of the current
[50:43] state of the world I think a lot of
[50:45] people I like yeah they tend to fall
[50:46] into that category which is the um the
[50:50] op like it's The Optimist but it's also
[50:53] like a you have to think something's
[50:55] broken right before you're going to go
[50:57] fix something or make make something
[50:59] better and so yeah anybody that's that's
[51:02] self critical that's thinking about the
[51:06] way people are currently you know
[51:08] whether it's Behavioral or societal like
[51:10] thinking critically about that I think
[51:12] is really important because it's very
[51:13] easy to fall into like traps of status
[51:17] quo right and any anyone that says hey
[51:20] well we're actually making a pretty key
[51:23] assumption on in this huge area that's
[51:25] probably worth revisiting anyone that
[51:28] brings that to the Forefront I think is
[51:31] extremely valuable an extremely valuable
[51:33] dinner guest
[51:35] yeah absolutely because I think we're
[51:38] all a lot of VCS well not all but a lot
[51:42] of the good VCS have to be optimists
[51:44] because they have to believe in
[51:46] something at a point where it's almost
[51:48] irrational to believe but then the
[51:50] really best VCS I think are the ones
[51:53] that have a very sharp crit view of the
[51:57] world and are open-minded to the
[52:00] possibilities of what could change yeah
[52:03] I'm motivated by The Optimist side and I
[52:05] I now view any problem as very very easy
[52:08] to solve because we have a full toolkit
[52:10] so once you got a full toolkit like
[52:13] what's the problem you can figure out
[52:14] how to solve it many problems now you
[52:17] got then you have like
[52:19] social like how does society work
[52:22] together that that can get tricky and
[52:24] that plays into politics so politics
[52:26] doesn't really really uh doesn't fit
[52:29] nicely into that framework of we're
[52:31] going to go solve like engineering
[52:34] problems just yeah very different very
[52:38] different things so I always think about
[52:39] all right what roughly what's off track
[52:42] what's on track I I don't there aren't
[52:44] that many people in my personal life
[52:47] that are easy uh people to talk to about
[52:51] some of those issues so
[52:56] are people frightened about the topics
[53:00] that these kind of conversations can AR
[53:03] like grow around I yeah most it's not
[53:06] frighten but people tend to want like
[53:10] having open topics that are never
[53:12] resolved is not everybody's cup of tea
[53:16] many people if there's a problem they
[53:18] want to resolve it and so the easiest
[53:20] way to resolve things is political like
[53:22] politics it's an easy way to resolve
[53:24] something like oh is the other group
[53:26] said that well it's wrong and then I can
[53:28] just go about my
[53:30] business you know want everybody so
[53:32] distracted by everything and asking
[53:35] inless questions about maybe
[53:38] foundational assumptions to current like
[53:41] present day Society where it's just like
[53:42] ripping out the things that people need
[53:45] for stability and consistency right and
[53:48] so I think it's it's interesting to have
[53:51] really bright people that are doing that
[53:52] or have been doing that for decades and
[53:55] then them coming together around that
[53:57] but it can also I mean it can turn you
[53:59] into pessimist really fast if you do
[54:01] that and so there is a
[54:03] trick it's not a trick it's more of a
[54:06] line and you got to write it and one way
[54:08] I've seen like Peter
[54:10] teal not in person but on YouTube do
[54:13] this is he will he'll take a topic and
[54:18] kind of examine all the viewpoints
[54:20] around it and not make an like a
[54:23] personal assessment on which one's right
[54:26] yeah I think that allows them to to not
[54:29] get too overly invested in one of the
[54:31] ways like one of the answers because if
[54:33] you do that and then no one
[54:35] else gets on that side like dude that's
[54:39] that's painful
[54:40] yeah just is it his famous saying strong
[54:43] opinions loosely held is that Pete steel
[54:46] uh I think that was ma but yeah no I'm
[54:49] kidding I don't know who
[54:51] that strong opinions loosely held let's
[54:53] just have a quick
[54:54] look Church
[55:00] I'm trying to find it's definitely from
[55:02] someone it might be
[55:04] Bradfield Brad Feld it's not Brad
[55:08] Feld it's probably blog it's not him
[55:12] it's in it's in one of the books I've
[55:15] read and I think it might
[55:17] be it might be it might be Peter teal 0
[55:21] to
[55:23] one it's I mean it's a pretty
[55:26] classic quote or is it just a general
[55:30] quote it's a pretty General quote Yeah
[55:33] okay fair enough but it's still he
[55:36] obviously embodies it a little bit
[55:37] here's what I like let let me say one
[55:39] more thing about Peter he has a pretty
[55:42] strong articulation of his personal
[55:45] principles and
[55:47] belief and I think most if I could get
[55:50] people advice it' be to have that for
[55:53] yourself what do
[55:54] yous all right number one I think people
[55:58] have to they have to be you got to be
[55:59] optimistic just to get anything done you
[56:02] have to be optimistic number two you got
[56:04] to treat people really well you got to
[56:06] treat every person you meet really
[56:08] really well and you got to play very
[56:11] like very long term take a very long
[56:14] time Horizon with everybody that you
[56:16] meet and then I'd say the the other the
[56:19] third thing is invest with no
[56:22] expectation of return like not not
[56:25] dollars but in time and like people and
[56:28] just do that if you just plow those
[56:31] three things together you don't have to
[56:32] worry about any of the outcomes really
[56:35] at all so those those are three big
[56:37] things and then the fourth one is life's
[56:41] just way easier if you're building
[56:43] towards that big Vision the thing that
[56:44] you care about so for me it's how do
[56:47] make it easier to distribute new
[56:49] technology if you do that then you're
[56:50] going to get more new technology because
[56:52] it's going to be easier to distribute
[56:54] and grow when I look around like at
[56:55] company around the world there's not
[56:58] much Innovation there's a lot of cash
[57:00] that gets generated in profits and then
[57:02] there's nothing to do with it and so we
[57:05] mostly hand it back to governments and
[57:06] they just spend it and not getting it
[57:09] not getting good return on it then we
[57:10] wonder why economic growth is pretty low
[57:13] so I always think about all right do we
[57:15] have really
[57:17] good long-term R&D plans on what we're
[57:20] going to do and the thing that I learned
[57:22] from Elon was always be unlocking larger
[57:26] markets with your road map most
[57:29] companies unlock smaller markets with
[57:31] their road map so they will say we have
[57:34] this big thing it's a huge pain point
[57:35] for customers and then we're all gonna
[57:36] also going to sell them down the road
[57:38] these little things that are not as
[57:40] painful he goes the opposite way and
[57:42] says let's build everything's a platform
[57:44] let's build up and as we build up we're
[57:46] going to unlock the next massive market
[57:49] and that's how you get trillion dollar
[57:51] outcomes think it's import I think right
[57:54] now it's
[57:55] important for a couple of things so
[57:58] number one would be I think there's a
[58:01] little bit of like a freedom of speech
[58:04] kind
[58:05] of discussion happening globally and I
[58:09] think that I think people are
[58:12] pretty we're not great at this we're not
[58:14] great at at having definitive truth
[58:18] answers and so I think you're going to
[58:20] need to resist the idea that government
[58:22] is going to be able to do that at any
[58:24] capable level like they've never proven
[58:26] been capable of doing that and then
[58:29] there's a lot of AD homant attacks
[58:30] there's attacks on people for their
[58:32] beliefs people for their opinions and
[58:35] that's just generally not helpful like
[58:37] it's going to make you miserable as a
[58:39] person to be around so watch out for
[58:41] that watch out for algorithm bubbles
[58:43] like where you're only you're in one
[58:46] side that's all you hear and then you
[58:48] villainize the other side that's that's
[58:50] another path to pain and Devastation and
[58:53] despair so watch out for that and then
[58:56] another one I have friends that are
[58:59] Israeli and they have a war going on
[59:02] right now and you've got a serious
[59:05] amount of
[59:08] atrocities that are being committed and
[59:10] felt on people and Gaza and people in
[59:13] Israel and for people that are in those
[59:17] C they're like there's almost I see this
[59:20] wall come out where there's no path
[59:21] forward to
[59:23] peace and I my my encouragement for
[59:26] everybody is like whether you see
[59:29] one whether you see a path to peace or
[59:31] not in any conflict I need you to commit
[59:34] to trying to get to the peaceful outcome
[59:37] you may not know how to do it you may
[59:39] not see that path right now but I need
[59:40] to commit to doing that otherwise it's
[59:43] just like dude who wants a World War
[59:45] nobody right nobody so you have these
[59:47] are things that we have to resist and
[59:49] it's not not just like in voting but how
[59:52] we talk about these issues with people
[59:54] with each other is we need to we need to
[59:56] be able to have that conversation okay
[59:58] do we still agree that we should try to
[60:00] avoid World War okay do we believe that
[60:04] people have the right to make decisions
[60:07] for themselves and evaluate firsthand
[60:11] evidence to come to their own
[60:13] conclusions on important topics I think
[60:15] the answer to that is yes and so those
[60:17] are like two really big ones there's
[60:19] also another one big one now in AI with
[60:22] governments wanting to approve official
[60:24] government AI models I'm like this is a
[60:27] this is [ __ ] disaster this is just
[60:29] think about how much you use it today
[60:31] now think about how much our kids are
[60:32] going to use it and how de facto trusted
[60:35] it's going to be we're we're coming at
[60:37] it from oh it's disinformation or it
[60:39] started off with hallucinations when
[60:41] those get moved out of the way it's
[60:42] going to be the default way to learn
[60:44] pretty much everything and so you cannot
[60:47] have you cannot have a government
[60:50] approving safety or whatever they call
[60:52] safety you cannot have it approving the
[60:54] official storyline that's that's
[60:56] literally how you end up with
[60:57] totalitarian states that are controlling
[61:00] everything so I I don't like where
[61:01] that's heading I feel like certain
[61:04] companies open AI is missing that
[61:07] opportunity to resist that in a very
[61:09] important way I think they have a lot of
[61:11] credibility and and Leadership potential
[61:14] to resist that and they're not doing it
[61:16] and that's um not good I don't like that
[61:19] at all and uh let's see here what else
[61:23] oh what's the deal with Europe and you
[61:26] guys are
[61:27] like y'all
[61:29] are France is arresting pav from
[61:33] telegram I don't can I even go to Europe
[61:35] anymore I'm not going to China anymore
[61:38] can I go to Europe I can't go to Russia
[61:41] I can't go to Israel to war zone I can't
[61:43] go to Ukraine as war zone I'm a little
[61:44] bit nervous about global my Global
[61:47] Travel interest has falling off a cliff
[61:51] and it's largely you have the
[61:53] ideological components and you have real
[61:55] war
[61:56] and I feel like you know I want to see
[61:59] that inflict I want to see us bottom out
[62:01] on that I want to see things get back to
[62:04] where where things are good around the
[62:07] world Paul I think I might have to add
[62:09] you to my dinner party guest game you
[62:11] obviously went through a lot of

related to Tech and Venture Capital offering valuable takeaways and actionable insights we hope you enjoy the show and find something useful in each discussion let's get started hi Paul welcome to the riding unicorns podcast we are delighted to have you on we definitely will not be able to cover everything that we'd like to discuss because there's so much that we want to dive into but maybe we could just start with a quick introduction to yourself and copy AI sure so I'm pal the founder and CEO of copy AI we started the company back in 2020 to to help distribute the value of gpt3 at that time to the whole world so we build a prummer product that helps people create marketing and sales copy and content we're now automating lots of these go to market workflows and who have built an Enterprise product that's really taking off right now it's fantastic um business you've raised money from incredible investors globally I have tons of questions on the business and we um you know look forward to getting into into all of that stuff and how you're grow so fast and what the future holds but tell us a bit about your career um before we get into all of that you've had quite a Vari career accounting hedge funds I think a bunch of other stuff but tell us about it in your own words and what led you to copy hour yeah sure I grew up in a family of entrepreneurs so my parents had like a retail business and so I grew up in that thinking about business from a very young age and got really excited about technology in the late 90s when I was in Middle School and my role model at that time was not Michael Jordan it was Bill Gates because he had invented Windows 95 which was crazy at that time so we got the internet like hype bug in the late 90s my dad started day trading stocks in the bull market back then and I started day trading stocks too I had no idea what I was doing so you ride the wave and then when that wave corrects it makes you really go okay well what what's actually going on what are the underlying economics what is accounting what is an actual balance sheet what does it tell you and I had no clue right so I went what started out as a an accountant at CPA got into the hedge fund business when the cloud stocks were really iping in the early 2010s and at that time everybody was short these stocks they were extremely highly valued but the growth what growth rates were off the charts and so the question I had to figure out was what is it about SAS as a business model that makes that allows companies to compound at high rates of growth for a very long time and what are what are the mechanisms of that growth what are the underlying levers that these companies use to drive that growth that's a long way of saying I wanted to build those foundational blocks before diving in and starting a company i' always had a lot of ideas and expressed those in like different experiments or different ways to test it but nothing really at the point where it could it could be like unicorn potential at least uh back then so before we started this I was in the Venture business so we were helping employees exercise their stock options and what we realized was there's a finite number of companies that are investable and to Source those Investments you just need a list of everybody that works at those companies and you could start to actually piece together a Bottoms Up view of the entire Market that you're trying to invest in so it's a very much a comprehensive view do we have full coverage it's all data driven uh and then it's all connected into the growth and go to market way to Source those Investments to create copy and messaging and content for that particular audience and we crushed that we did a really nice job we got both of those funds that we were investing in in the carried carried interest mode which means we repaid all the investment money back and we were then sharing in the upside with our limited partners so that that was great and in that lens you can I I love businesses I'm a you know a student of business models i' had seen several hundred as an accountant several hundred as a public market investor and then more like a thousand or 2,000 in the Venture business because it's pretty much everything that was series a and Beyond so once you see it all the pattern matching is off the charts and when you're going to go build a new business you're just picking and choosing like the best parts of every one of these models and that that is a a tried and true technique for kind of drisking your plan going into something new I've learned a lot in in the meantime and we'll get into that yeah and the I I mean the the VC fund that you were General partner in sounds like a VC fund that an entrepreneur would co-found right it's not like a typical ass management play oh for sure yeah for sure so these are these are some uh friends of mine when they started it they they were the first firm to actually have that strategy this is in 2012 and at the time I was at at at the hedge fund and I got the deck for this new fund and I was like I have no idea what any of this means they're talking about stock options and 409a valuations and how they're going to come in at a discount and how you'd get participating preferred like equi upside structures with it this downside protection I'm like I have no idea what any of this stuff means and it was fun to see that play out and then my career path go realign to that and say you know what actually they have found an opportunity and then there's a way to tighten up the diligent side tighten up the underwriting side and uh build you could what was interesting you could actually build Dynamic options pricing models which we had for every single private company which is fun fun task to do well we we have so many listeners of this podcast who are stock option holders and oh man probably split in their approach some of them probably think they're rich when in fact they may well not not end up being rich from them some probably treated as zero and it's all bonus if if it does come through but how can there's a bunch of complexities around selling stock options who can buy them who can sell them um who need what approvals do you need from who like how how did you make this work in practice uh I know there's not a podcast about this but this is I love this too it's really interesting to me so I'll give like maybe a quick overview of the typical situation so you want to join a startup this and these are us startups that we have two different types of option grants one's called an ISO and one's called NSO the iso is the most tax preferred so you if you're an employee of a US startup you will likely get ISO grants and when you join the company says okay here's some here's the option to buy this this amount of shares roughly it equates to this percentage of the company and because it's common stock and because these companies typically are not the the preferred holders value the company at a certain price but they only put so much money in so if the company's valued at 100 million and they've invested 20 there's only $20 million of return that needs to get cleared before the common stock starts to be worth something so right away you can see the common stock is valuable but not anywhere near as valuable as the preferred stock when the company gets that option price and valued like value of that common stock it tends to be like 10 cents on the dollar to the preferred stock so it's like somebody saying hey here's $100,000 worth of stock if you want to buy it you have to pay us 10,000 bucks that's a great deal so that's one piece of it now you have so many companies you're going to have like half that don't return that money and half the companies are just not going to it's not going to work out the other half you might get something and then you have this huge power law curve where the top 1% of companies are returning usually most of the money in Venture so the real question isn't are my options going to be worth something it's more hey is this company working out in a really big way right and so it tends to be that if you are a world class employee like this is where it gets uh there's a little bit of reflexivity in it if you're a world class employeee and you know it and this and you want to work for this company that's a great sign like that stock is probably going to be worth something if you are not a world class employee and this is your first job in the Venture and there's no reason you should have gotten the job and the questions they ask you are relatively simple and they hire you right away it's probably not going to be worth much money the whole game in venture has been talent you have to build Talent density you have to get the absolute best people on the planet because this is these are the hardest problems period and in order to solve them you need human Talent you need the best talent on the planet and so everything starts with talent and you can typically look at the companies and the quality of people as you interview and meet the people at the company you can assess does this does this company have a high Talent part or not and the best people unfortunately for new Founders the best people only work with people that they have the best like the world class Talent will only join companies where they're the best people they have ever worked with work and so you can't put up a job posting and get random people applying it's not going to work you're never going to build talent that way you have to go out you have to seek people out and you have to figure out how to tap into those those networks but really it just comes down to you need to be excellent and you're it's not just day one but you need to have a really fast trajectory like upward in in how good you you get as a founder and then how how great you can build a team around that like it has to be truly world class if it's not truly world class and you feel it in your bones I wouldn't necessarily go exercise a bunch of stock options yeah and we we're gonna we're GNA talk all about that you're obviously now in the talent acquisition game you're that's raising great great great investors and you're doing really well but just leading to that what were the things that led you to becoming a Founder like always wanted to be a Founder you always wanted to be a Founder okay yeah in my in my bones I mean my dad is like an immigrant to America so he moved to America built his own company did things was very entrepreneurial so I had that kind of as a very young kid in a lot of different ways so what were the factors that aligned and me 2020 was the time good question I done different like side project type startup things where I had some Viewpoint and would figure out try to test that pretty quickly and 2019 late 2019 we got gpt2 that had come out and so I started using that to brainstorm and I was like man I can this is like a brainstorming accelerator because I can just type in some stuff some idea I have and let it auto complete and it's just hallucinating and making things up and it would take my idea way further than I even thought and so I was like man I feel like there's like a box and it's got gold in it and I I'm like lifting like the top cover off just a little bit is like using the model but there's like a whole pile gold underneath it and pandemic happens there's like a feedback loop there's always a feedback loop when the pandemic hit Twitter blew up because everybody's on Twitter all day long then people start to build things you start to get influenced you're like whoa he's building something they're building something like what am I building what are we launching so that was part of it the other part was we had we had started investing in employees own startups like people were leaving great companies to start their own so we started investing in those and when you see somebody go yeah I got an idea and did this at this company and I'm going to put this company together and you're like cool here's here's 10 grand I don't think I don't here like try to get it to work I hope I can help you out in any way possible but then six weeks later they have a team they have a product they have a new investment round like they have customers and you're like in six weeks there's a there's some thing that just jogs this [ __ ] out of you and you go well wait a second I can make a huge amount of progress and have these three three wheels to play off of each other to spin this kind of momentum flywheel number one is people and it's all sales all of this is sales can I sell someone to join me and build something when we have nothing that's a hard that's a hard sell It's A Hard Sell for technical Talent is why Founders usually co-found companies with friends doesn't always work out but it's like a decent place to be second one is will anybody use the product or can I get customers there's a lot of Hustle around that and then on on the investor side there's a lot of hustle as well so you have to deal with rejection constantly having a a mental framework of okay there a numbers game we're going to ask a 100 people every time we get rejected we're going to listen to what the rejection reason was and we're going to fix something either in in the way we're operating the business or we could disregard that you objection or we can change how we frame what we're doing and a lot of times when I work with Founders most they're they're on to something big but it's a little bit challenging for them to communicate and articulate that back and explain in a way that investors kind of mindset is built on why that's going to be big and so a lot of it's like just that initial kind of tweaking and then a little bit of that process that goes into it so once I've learned from other Founders oh yeah here's the process oh dude this is easy like what so I was what do we want to do what's the most ambitious thing the biggest thing we want to do if we the a vision really big what is that going to be and we just said hey look if if there was a way to grow companies and solve this distribution challenge of Distributing Innovative technology then we'd be as a whole Humanity we'd be able to innovate a lot faster because the the feedback loop would be way tighter between coming up with something new and getting it in people's hands so that's a massive problem it's a sales and marketing problem it's a distribution problem it's a growth problem in Silicon Valley the way you solve those problems and you just have to go hire the guy or girl that figured it out at some other company you have to hire them and literally pay them to work for you or else you will [ __ ] up so that was it you either recruited a person that knew the secret sauce or you didn't you just prayed that somebody else would figure it out and it's really hard to do that and so it's nice for a handful of companies that can go recruit those people like we are one of those companies is now recruiting those people which is great but it doesn't scale across the whole global economy and I don't like that I really hate that and so we're building these technology platform now so that once we get this thing that's working really well we can just copy it and paste it into customer accounts and say here you go here's something that's this is truly a world-class process you take that and and really run with it and make it your own inside of your own company but a lot of the buil like there are basically not enough building blocks that were big enough building blocks we have you have idees you have coding interfaces yeah you can take like a framework and adapt it but on the on the goto Market side you really didn't have anything like that you could buy some of the tools you could buy HubSpot or Salesforce but you could buy the best best-in-class software stack and not grow your business at all like cat Hall so there's something about the promise of all these tools and we're it's going to help you grow and all the ROI and then it just never showed up because the operator is the one that drives value through it historically if your user is unsophisticated or doesn't quite know exactly what they should do with it you're not going to get value out of the software that's now changing and so the software has a better consciousness of the data the business logic it has an idea of how you might grow your business and so what we're doing now is just building a platform that makes it easier to apply that to your business and so how do we get those insights all it's all data driven how do we take all of that and create it's l literally like basic marketing and sales campaigns that work right it's just the basics stuff yeah and Paul you mentioned having a big Vision so you knew you wanted to build something big and impactful but then you've also talked there about they not being a big enough building blocks to get started and so my question really is around automation agents AI they're all big now Buzz workor but they weren't when you started the company really and so how much of the mission has evolved and how much is it had to evolve us as what the what the first situation was and what is the responsibility it has not it has not changed it's not changed so you literally you had a vision and yeah right when right when gpt3 came out this July of 2020 I was just I went crazy I was just tweeting about this I have all the Tweet logs I was like gbd3 is a phase change of the internet and so the phase change is we've been uploading stuff to it constantly right it's a giant content flywheel so you upload stuff to it and then that attracts people to go use it and download it information from the internet and Google is sitting at the center of it because they organize it and then they incentivize you to upload more stuff so that you'll be found right even with like podcasts you're trying to be found in the algorithm so the bottleneck to that system system is that people only have so many hours of day to consume that information and content right we can't just I mean they're not more than 24 hours in a day and they're not more than eight billion people so the big Insight here was computers can now make sense of that content they can make sense of that information and so what's going to happen is an increasing share of the consumption of that is going to happen by computers and not people and then the flip side of that is it's going to be way easier to make content because because it was very hard to make content before you had to do everything manually there was really there were really no tools to doing that and definitely not good tools at doing that at scale so now you can start to abstract away and work at a more meta level and once you have that then you can take think about what happened we took the whole internet huge ass internet and compressed it into this tiny thing we can ping anytime we want to add a little sprinkle of intelligence into any process right how is that not going to end up in embedded into every business process we have as a company it is just fundamentally there's just's no chance that it doesn't so we had that that was a a long that's been the vision pretty much forever the real question is just timing like gpt3 not good enough to get there but it's showing you those initial use cases that's blowing people away right because we thought okay well all it can do is retrieve and copy and paste but it can't generate something net knew but it was doing that so that that was like a big insight and I was like well okay well what's the value of all words that could potentially be generated and I was like that's in the that's I don't know what's beyond a trillions I'm like it's a huge amount right so we people are still selling all of this way short in terms of the impact it's going to have we're still in like in one which is how do we integrate llms into our business processes and even though that's that's phase two of our business it's still phase one of how do you actually get an impact out of this and it's just going to take it's going to take a little bit of time people have to get really comfortable with it the models have to improve to a certain level where where you can you have trust in the performance of it the outputs the inputs how to work with it and it definitely requires a rewrite and a rethinking of uh Legacy software systems which were built for structured data structured data is unstructured data that we chopped off a lot of valuable information from in order to fit it into a table right so that think about it like that that there's no chance that that's going to stick around all the unstructured data is going to beat structured data because it doesn't have information loss attached to it so you have a lot of like pieces of the story that come into play and then I had another tweet which was like if you're building like a gpt3 app and a VC asks you why now I was like don't don't walk away run that's literally went into like beta the day before I just lost my mind I'm like this is clearly the future and it's pretty exciting to be early on it so tell us tell us why tell us tell us why VC shouldn't run from from copy I mean oh this is four years ago this is four years ago yeah just I see four years ago just to give some context to our listeners like VC's are skeptical about llm rappers thin layers thin use cases on top of llms which provides some light workflow tooling to users but could fundamentally be displaced or chewed up by the foundation model providers in the long run what is it that you guys are doing to mean you have a shot at being a huge winner in this space in in in the long run yeah I'd say the important thing is to sell your product to the market and not to VCS right the market will never ask you that question what the market is asking right now and this is this is SE sweep and down they're basically saying hey look AI is is here it's legit and as a company we're going to have to really transition the whole thing over to it this this is a very that's a very high anxiety moment for companies and people working right and so now okay we're g to you set the vision we're going to transition the whole thing great how do we do it what what are we going to do are we going to ask every employee to become an AI engineer and try to train everyone on systems thinking data model design prompt engineering is that even like that let's put that at the very base of options right the very base option is everyone has to become a full stack engineer in engineer these systems at the very top of this pyramid of let's call it effort right is there's a company that sells the entire system and I can just pay them money and they will install the entire system and they will solve my problem and I can just hand them millions of dollars and I get it tomorrow okay does that make sense yeah so if you're if you're the CEO which one are you gonna which one are you going to do yeah I I think it's exciting because we are entering that kind of application layer of AI I didn't answer his question yet about the rapper but so you have at the very top is I'm a CEO I buy it tomorrow and it's installed and I'm done with my AI roll out right so the journey up that that's a value Journey that you have to create as a business providing Solutions right so you could you could start at the bottom and say we're going to build a training company we're going to Train everybody on how to do all this [ __ ] right or you could say look our sites are actually how do we reduce the friction of adoption so how do we make the pl product the platform way easier how do we abstract away all this complexity around llm selection e evaluation prompt engineering all the different data providers that have to get orchestrated and brought in to make these workflow right we're talking about hundreds of them it's not an insignificant amount of engineering effort right we're not a huge company so you have to pick those battles and basically architect your road map so that you're able to get to that dream state where I can go to a CEO with confidence and say look we have a system we're working with your direct competitors they're buying this system all right this is the output this is the results they're getting this is the level of streamlining across the board right and this is the the kind of visibility you can get into your Market that you're targeting that level of product that's kind of like you got to set that Vision a little bit and then you got to go get there so where you going to start yeah you're going to put it you're going to bolt an llm into a workflow automation product right that's your starting point then the question is do you have the right path to getting there and delivering that system there are going to be companies that get there so our goal is to get there faster than everybody else so how do you get there you have the best team you have the best go to market you the best marketing team you get the best Legion you're building a category like you this is a time where you can build a category as a young company there are a lot of of way that are not technical Mo they get you there from a technical Moe standpoint every company is unique so every company is going to build their own data Foundation they're going to have data that makes their system work in a very specific way to them so that data is going to live in our platform that becomes a data mode and then the process is how you take that data and orchestrate it to execute the workloads that creates process mode as well so these this type of model has been done all the time service now did it Salesforce did it their platforms they are extremely sticky you cannot rip them out once you get a few of these workflows embedded in them and Paul I completely agree in the sense that the AI is just a tool it's a bit of infrastructure that you build into just a tool it's not just a tool it's beyond a tool it's so it's such of your product it's not the product if that I'm trying to be yeah it's it's a different positive I would say that it is a it was the missing ingredient right to the whole data all of all the data all the it's product critical but it's just one part of the product it's a critical part obviously but if we and and then you've just talked there about how everything else your own approach your own execution your own product your own sales everything leads to success I think the question we have as VCS and what we'd love to understand more of is that you can go and build a really great business doing what you're doing because of all of the things you've just talked about great execution great product great talent right plus AI but will we have like Winner Takes all companies when the barrier to entry becomes a little a little lower or we all start to use these tools I mean what what do you think about that as a former VC now founder of an AI company what the alarm bells are going off in some VC funds quarters because they're like I don't know what's defensible and they don't actually know you obviously think it is very defensible and rightly think I'd love to hear your pitch on that as like how do you become a winner takes all when you are using this AI infrastructure to build incredibly powerful products yeah the winner takes all effect the the first place it will position itself as inside of one business and the way that LMS work the more data you give it the better the performance gets so that means that there is a natural consolidation force and an aggregation Force for every company every company will have to have all their data in one place right now there's nowhere for that data to go and there's no easy way to take that data and drive action from it so you have there will be a plat form in every company so that's like a starting point view on how this category is going to shape out in terms of how you win you need to win uh you need to land companies quickly and then you need to have that strategic conversation with them about their road map and just align the way that they're going to roll these use cases out internally to your product platform so that's how you win an account then how you win a whole lot of accounts is you just Blitz create and just there's no shortcut you just have to [ __ ] win it I think you try to find I always try to find places where there there's not a lot of direct incumbent like edgo Edge competition and you can kind of like slip in and do that this this is one of the few I think places where that that is the case I think it's a lot harder in many of the other categories that I think have demanded a lot of investment dollars I think it's I don't think I don't actually think that U first of all I think think the moat here is massive like way bigger than people realize you can't rip out core foundational business processes right that's and it's never been possible before the things that get ripped out are humanin thee Loop tools so if you have a business process workflow and you're saying hey we're gonna help James do his this particular task better but you could swap in any tool onto that task that's that's easy to rip out that's like saying okay well I'm not g use Chad GPT this week I'm use Claude well how how what's the Moe L the Moe is you've been programmed to type in chat GPT in your browser and you might have a a oneclick button right that gets you going that's the Moe that keeps you back in the business side all of this data is coming in to one system when we abstract away the llm complexity you end up with actions these actions are like independent applications there is logic that we own that in the back end that customers don't have any clue what's going on and there's no reason that they should because that is a platform that's a platform IP piece that we bring to the table and we solve this problem for them so when you start yeah yeah how have you seen your the performance of your product improve over time because I think the the the moat debate and the win it takes all debate two two separate debates right definitely super sticky but very curious to hear how fine-tuning models company data are there are there shared learnings are you allowed to use one company's data to improve the next companies is that benchmarking that you can do across your user base how how are you building any of those sort of network effects into your product yeah it's a good question we have core platform actions that are valuable across companies and we own that and we don't we're not using their data to fine tune on that but we use the data to understand analytics on is this working is it is is the is our core platform action improving or not uh when you St those things away you start to get platform effects at that level the other thing is use cases a lot of companies really need more opinionated guidance on what use cases to start with which ones to go after they're not doing this fulltime right there're this is their first go around of doing Ai implementations and really rethinking their business workflows and so we come with we come prepared with that as a company that's that's a very valuable piece to this we didn't always have this I like being opinionated I don't know if you guys can tell but a lot of firm a lot of companies don't want to be opinionated they say here's the tools here's the keys like go go wild and what we've seen is probably nine to nine and a half times out of 10 people will use the the tooling to basically go build the human in the loop task accelerator right they're not systems thinking because that's not been their problem their problem has been getting a particular job done and as a result if you ask them what do you want they'll tell you I want the faster horse right they won't they won't articulate or invent the car they've never had experience doing that they've never thought about the Inn system they've thought about their role in these business processes then the other issue is torg they've not ever built go to market use cases they're very much building infrastructure maybe business logic we routing back office stuff but nothing front office side for the go to market team so you're in this position where the market will get developed over time but it's really like very hungry for more of a full service more full full stack approach to what their own road map should be That's Unique I I you don't see that very often most of the time it's okay here's the tool like this is how Dropbox uses it and you just walk away and you say hey here's a Dropbox case study well guess what Dropbox had an awesome team and if they're only getting it 15% like lift in some key metric the average user is not getting [ __ ] like they're wasting their time and money on the tool right because of the user sophistication problem so for us we got to solve that thing we got to bring we got to bring more to the table for companies and Paul when we look at an infrastructure player like open AI they OB they obviously have some of their own applications EG yeah where do you think the lines stop or like the strategies stop are they are they going to develop more of their own applications or do you think that they will accept a position as an infrastructure player and chat GPT as just trying to show the world what it can do to encourage people to then come and build businesses on top and is it as simple to bucket companies or Tech into infra versus app what's your view on that because I think everyone's trying to build an opinion of that well you just ask customers what what do they want so if you ask Enterprises they said like seven out of 10 want to move everything to open source models like by the end of next year and when you ask Enterprises well how do you feel about open AI they're like well we don't want to be stuck on one provider and so when you start out and you're known as being the one model provider you are really stuck from being able to offer a full Suite of cloud services around that and so they haven't done that they' they've gone the other route which is okay we tried the a the API thing I think when they first launched it in 2021 we were 14% of their revenue that year which is pretty fun like a couple of the apps were doing more Revenue than open a was and I think they saw that and went okay well there's a race to the bottom on llms in terms of cost right let's go build an app and go make some money and then we'll figure out how to sell that so they've been doing that they've been doing good job with that building their distribution Partnerships building more consumer prosumer type products they're going to have Enterprise Products that's that everybody else will and you still have to win win trust win loyalty figure out distribution so I've always treated them more like another Microsoft another Google another Amazon uh we work really closely with their the early team there they're some of the best yeah best people good people right people and so I I just I don't ever worry about what they're doing at all we have a we have a pretty Clear Vision has not changed right and they're there if anything they've only helped us get there faster with with the kind of Innovations they've had on the llm side and now you have other you have other providers you've got anthropic that is as good or better for many of these cases you've got M you've got meta now contributing llama as an open source model which Rivals both right so it is a as a wedge into the market the LMS they put a lot of pieces in motion with the work that they did and now if you're like anthropic you might have the best model maybe a better product and then it's still it's still hard to compete against open AI so we try to just say look this is a piece of the whole solution and it's is it winner take all like you would have thought Cloud would be a winner take all instead you have an oligopoly and what ended up happening was when they got down to three players they had I don't know if you guys saw this chart I saw it I think yesterday on on X and I was like oh [ __ ] this is it it was basically the price drop for AWS Azure and Google Cloud on a price per gigabyte per month of Hosting was falling off a [ __ ] cliff and then in 2016 it flatlined magically it has not moved and then all of a sudden these things become cash counts for every and I think with the llms there's probably a moment where they get you know they just get so cheap that and you have this explosion of use cases around it what's what's tricky right now is the prices are falling faster than companies can figure out how to scale volume in consumption right because it's not to build the systems that consume is non-trivial that's the problem that we're trying to help companies with right building a platform that right we're still so early with the application you mean you're so early the fact that you started four years ago and we've only had a handful of application layer AI companies yeah I mean look the the simplest application is I ask it to do one type of use case and it gives me a response right that's an app and then the more complex one is okay well how do we how do we solve a really big hairy problem where there's a lot of orchest ation a lot of data that has to come together and then the output quality has to be at such a high bar that it actually does Drive business value this is not trivial it's not trivial [ __ ] to do for one company and it's it's much harder to scale that across different companies and then to build the system where it's you're driving the flywheel effect which is what we go after we don't care about funnels we care about flywheel effects to to build it where it goes after the flywheel effect you want to preconfig the whole thing and the next phase for us is once once we have the data Foundation which we'll be releasing later this year alongside the workflow automation piece then you can hand the keys over to the llm and say hey what should we what else could we do make some recommendations and at that point you're not going to be B bottleneck by people like thinking about this [ __ ] coding it up testing it the system will do that so once you have the system doing it you will have released the last major bottleneck which is engineering of workflow process and at that point then then it's okay now we got to gate and figure out well how do we how do we test and put some kind of guard rails and controls on that but then at another Point once it figures the [ __ ] out it's just going to go and then once it goes you're gonna that's like a real scoped autonomous system but for for very specific workflows which are the growth workflows fascinating pool and we could again it's another topic we could have a whole podcast around but we have to pack everything into a short space unfortunately but I give you an you an example of one I'm testing a product skew for VCS called the AI associate okay and so think about it this way you have let's say you identify a company you're interested in and you want to get in front of the of the founder what do you typically do you're going to send me a message what's the message GNA say good to hear about what you bu I've played with your product I think it's awesome can we can we set up something like that does that work 100% of the time keep it short keep it sweet it's good to hear about what you're building okay well you don't need my help then okay let's say you invest in that company right and you're like hey we want to add value how do you add value to them I say who are your top three Target customers right now uhhuh and then see if is there someone in my network who knows them what role are you hiring for at the moment are there any other VCS you need to speak to add me on Whatsapp you can ask me to any anything at any time whatever it might be yeah yeah so exactly so what you can do if you ask an llm you say hey here's the company right I'm trying to help them out the lm's gonna ask you well who do you know and you're like well I know these 4,000 people it would just review all 4,000 and make recommendations on who be a good fit for that person to know and it's not across one thing most most Founders have multiple problems they're trying to hire they're trying to find customers and they're trying to raise money typically those three things right I don't know if you guys have ever had uh your memory jogged when you're looking through who you know go oh I should introduce them with so and right this is a data over we have data overload we know too many people there are way too many Miss opportunities because we don't we don't have the capacity to mentally scan through Rod X of 3,000 people every time we meet somebody new and so that's that's a good that's a good use case for AI 100% And and I think the I mean CRM enrichment is one piece of it you you need a lot of layers of context to be able to do good matching and it's something that we think about and we'll build we have phds Engineers on our team so it's it's something that we're working on it's a big unsolved problem and it's a good problem to to well I'm building in a way where I can I can copy and paste it across every VC so think about it the VC they know everybody they have the biggest Network like out of the box you should be able to add a million dollars of AR to every company that you meet with whether you're invested in them or not it's just my personal belief and I think once you once you can reliably add that value to companies everybody will want to work with you and not only that the companies you invest are going to grow much faster we're just blocked there's not there are too many people and too many opportunities and we don't have a systematic way of driving that yeah Paul I think it so tell us how are you doing it for your angel portfolio I just have good taste nothing fancy I'm like that [ __ ] exists and somebody builds it I'm like they're the ones basically I get a lot of signal just around what somebody built the fact that they built something to solve a specific problem that's a quick win for me and then thinking about how ambitious is that vision and are they just pumped the [ __ ] up about it are they excited about it because I know how hard it is to sell people to join you and raise money and sell customers and if you're not bring in the fire in every call you don't got it man it's an energy game and so I just look for that I look for that and then I I like again anyone that's just got a pretty ambitious Vision I feel and they have a good head on their shoulders to take put that's the other thing yeah definitely think we're looking for and you've certainly managed to pick some companies with big visions of mercury and Adil and others so oh man I was yeah I was early customer of of mercury andal I I had literally had that that was one of our ideas that we' had we had an idea for a company called robot tanle which was andril but basic but basically for consumers with there were high net worth right cuz it was about civilian defense systems right we're all very much subject to like how good our government is at protecting us but what we've seen across the board you see this in Ukraine is the the citizens were really not protected whatsoever and I'm like man somebody should sell civilian defense systems that are essentially at the same grade as the military ones and I was like it would be drones you'll have drones you'll have oh man what was it emps like literally you can't drone me if I EMP your [ __ ] out of the air right and then it got into well why do we need government at all well we need Municipal Services we need fresh water we need sewage work done I'm like I can build a rig like a literally an intermodal car and fill it with industrial equipment that does all of those functions and the total cost was like 40 grand for all of it I could have solar panels starlink compost ing toilets and like water water purification and storage systems all in one box and I was like if we had that we would literally we could live off the grid at our house we wouldn't need the municipal system at all I want to I want to see but I don't want to live in the world that you envisage it's it's better than this one all right this one's great I love this this world's like this world's awesome I don't I don't ever want to put down this world but it's just like these little things where something is very cheap that does the job and it takes away a lot of bureaucracy and slowness that we hate and it just makes it makes life more enjoyable my my ring doorbell feels like an insufficient defense mechanism now but it's all I've got ring was oh man ring was close my friend built a a cell phone tracker basically would pick up the cell phone ID and installed it at its door he worked for the FBI but anyway he installed at his door his house got broken into and he was able to trace the phone and and got the guy wow and what they did is they Apple only because they his phone right Apple ended up Banning that type of uh thing and so now they rotate the ideas IDs out so like our National Security Agency they can they track everything anyway so they know where all the phones are but he built it for his own his own self and then it paid off I was like dude yes I was like there's so many we got a lot of crime at least in the US that is uh no it's not they stole other stuff from his house but he he caught him because their phone was connecting to his his like Honeypot device right okay yeah I was like that's that is awesome that's awesome it's amazing there's still so many problems in the world that this this industry is going to look to try and fix well we got yeah we gotta solve all the ones the governments are creating right now for us unfortunately so Paul we've we've covered a lot of ground we've just got our final two questions so the first is a future unicorn prediction and then the second is our dinner party guest game so if you could have three oh my gosh our future unicorn so I'd have to give and it's other than copy other than our company I think taco t a KO so they are the ined in perplexity so if you like search in perplexity for betting market results or stock charts they're the ined that pops up and what they're doing is they're taking all the data that exists in private apis and they're rendering it in real time to answer these queries and actually build insights off that so that is something that's going to get embedded not only to every AI product but that API where it's a universal layer to access premium data that is going to be incredibly valuable for any kind of workflow that is running through AI agents I think most people now are going to be or a lot of companies are going to be thinking about what is our data strategy to monetize all this great information we have uh I think that is probably that's such a powerful spot to be in as an aggregator of kind of that really valuable Rich information so I'd have to give I gota give my buddy Alex shout out for that awesome very cool and I feel like perplexity is really getting used more and more and more by people get picks up more perplexity is already a unicorn that would have been that would have been one of my other ones cool I'll just do the last question then Paul uh dinner party guest game three dinner party guests all right we're going to go with I'm going to go with Peter teal I'm going to go with dougas Murray and I'm gonna go with Arnold chis Egger yeah that's awesome we've had Ary before but I'm can't remember who so Douglas Murray's he's like a actor right no he's a oh sorry he's a big yeah he's an author he's like a kind of he's a Brit and he's a kind of social commentary quite a bit yeah and it's make for a good dinner conversation and he really doesn't have nothing's really off off topic for him he he's the inspiration some behind some of your um sort of uh healthy critical analysis of the current state of the world I think a lot of people I like yeah they tend to fall into that category which is the um the op like it's The Optimist but it's also like a you have to think something's broken right before you're going to go fix something or make make something better and so yeah anybody that's that's self critical that's thinking about the way people are currently you know whether it's Behavioral or societal like thinking critically about that I think is really important because it's very easy to fall into like traps of status quo right and any anyone that says hey well we're actually making a pretty key assumption on in this huge area that's probably worth revisiting anyone that brings that to the Forefront I think is extremely valuable an extremely valuable dinner guest yeah absolutely because I think we're all a lot of VCS well not all but a lot of the good VCS have to be optimists because they have to believe in something at a point where it's almost irrational to believe but then the really best VCS I think are the ones that have a very sharp crit view of the world and are open-minded to the possibilities of what could change yeah I'm motivated by The Optimist side and I I now view any problem as very very easy to solve because we have a full toolkit so once you got a full toolkit like what's the problem you can figure out how to solve it many problems now you got then you have like social like how does society work together that that can get tricky and that plays into politics so politics doesn't really really uh doesn't fit nicely into that framework of we're going to go solve like engineering problems just yeah very different very different things so I always think about all right what roughly what's off track what's on track I I don't there aren't that many people in my personal life that are easy uh people to talk to about some of those issues so are people frightened about the topics that these kind of conversations can AR like grow around I yeah most it's not frighten but people tend to want like having open topics that are never resolved is not everybody's cup of tea many people if there's a problem they want to resolve it and so the easiest way to resolve things is political like politics it's an easy way to resolve something like oh is the other group said that well it's wrong and then I can just go about my business you know want everybody so distracted by everything and asking inless questions about maybe foundational assumptions to current like present day Society where it's just like ripping out the things that people need for stability and consistency right and so I think it's it's interesting to have really bright people that are doing that or have been doing that for decades and then them coming together around that but it can also I mean it can turn you into pessimist really fast if you do that and so there is a trick it's not a trick it's more of a line and you got to write it and one way I've seen like Peter teal not in person but on YouTube do this is he will he'll take a topic and kind of examine all the viewpoints around it and not make an like a personal assessment on which one's right yeah I think that allows them to to not get too overly invested in one of the ways like one of the answers because if you do that and then no one else gets on that side like dude that's that's painful yeah just is it his famous saying strong opinions loosely held is that Pete steel uh I think that was ma but yeah no I'm kidding I don't know who that strong opinions loosely held let's just have a quick look Church I'm trying to find it's definitely from someone it might be Bradfield Brad Feld it's not Brad Feld it's probably blog it's not him it's in it's in one of the books I've read and I think it might be it might be it might be Peter teal 0 to one it's I mean it's a pretty classic quote or is it just a general quote it's a pretty General quote Yeah okay fair enough but it's still he obviously embodies it a little bit here's what I like let let me say one more thing about Peter he has a pretty strong articulation of his personal principles and belief and I think most if I could get people advice it' be to have that for yourself what do yous all right number one I think people have to they have to be you got to be optimistic just to get anything done you have to be optimistic number two you got to treat people really well you got to treat every person you meet really really well and you got to play very like very long term take a very long time Horizon with everybody that you meet and then I'd say the the other the third thing is invest with no expectation of return like not not dollars but in time and like people and just do that if you just plow those three things together you don't have to worry about any of the outcomes really at all so those those are three big things and then the fourth one is life's just way easier if you're building towards that big Vision the thing that you care about so for me it's how do make it easier to distribute new technology if you do that then you're going to get more new technology because it's going to be easier to distribute and grow when I look around like at company around the world there's not much Innovation there's a lot of cash that gets generated in profits and then there's nothing to do with it and so we mostly hand it back to governments and they just spend it and not getting it not getting good return on it then we wonder why economic growth is pretty low so I always think about all right do we have really good long-term R&D plans on what we're going to do and the thing that I learned from Elon was always be unlocking larger markets with your road map most companies unlock smaller markets with their road map so they will say we have this big thing it's a huge pain point for customers and then we're all gonna also going to sell them down the road these little things that are not as painful he goes the opposite way and says let's build everything's a platform let's build up and as we build up we're going to unlock the next massive market and that's how you get trillion dollar outcomes think it's import I think right now it's important for a couple of things so number one would be I think there's a little bit of like a freedom of speech kind of discussion happening globally and I think that I think people are pretty we're not great at this we're not great at at having definitive truth answers and so I think you're going to need to resist the idea that government is going to be able to do that at any capable level like they've never proven been capable of doing that and then there's a lot of AD homant attacks there's attacks on people for their beliefs people for their opinions and that's just generally not helpful like it's going to make you miserable as a person to be around so watch out for that watch out for algorithm bubbles like where you're only you're in one side that's all you hear and then you villainize the other side that's that's another path to pain and Devastation and despair so watch out for that and then another one I have friends that are Israeli and they have a war going on right now and you've got a serious amount of atrocities that are being committed and felt on people and Gaza and people in Israel and for people that are in those C they're like there's almost I see this wall come out where there's no path forward to peace and I my my encouragement for everybody is like whether you see one whether you see a path to peace or not in any conflict I need you to commit to trying to get to the peaceful outcome you may not know how to do it you may not see that path right now but I need to commit to doing that otherwise it's just like dude who wants a World War nobody right nobody so you have these are things that we have to resist and it's not not just like in voting but how we talk about these issues with people with each other is we need to we need to be able to have that conversation okay do we still agree that we should try to avoid World War okay do we believe that people have the right to make decisions for themselves and evaluate firsthand evidence to come to their own conclusions on important topics I think the answer to that is yes and so those are like two really big ones there's also another one big one now in AI with governments wanting to approve official government AI models I'm like this is a this is [ __ ] disaster this is just think about how much you use it today now think about how much our kids are going to use it and how de facto trusted it's going to be we're we're coming at it from oh it's disinformation or it started off with hallucinations when those get moved out of the way it's going to be the default way to learn pretty much everything and so you cannot have you cannot have a government approving safety or whatever they call safety you cannot have it approving the official storyline that's that's literally how you end up with totalitarian states that are controlling everything so I I don't like where that's heading I feel like certain companies open AI is missing that opportunity to resist that in a very important way I think they have a lot of credibility and and Leadership potential to resist that and they're not doing it and that's um not good I don't like that at all and uh let's see here what else oh what's the deal with Europe and you guys are like y'all are France is arresting pav from telegram I don't can I even go to Europe anymore I'm not going to China anymore can I go to Europe I can't go to Russia I can't go to Israel to war zone I can't go to Ukraine as war zone I'm a little bit nervous about global my Global Travel interest has falling off a cliff and it's largely you have the ideological components and you have real war and I feel like you know I want to see that inflict I want to see us bottom out on that I want to see things get back to where where things are good around the world Paul I think I might have to add you to my dinner party guest game you obviously went through a lot of different sort of career chapters and Journeys before taking
