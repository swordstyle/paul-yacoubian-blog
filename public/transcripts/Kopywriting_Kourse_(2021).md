[00:00] hey it's neville here and today i want
[00:02] to talk to you about something called ai
[00:04] writing now computers have been helping
[00:06] writers for ages
[00:07] if we were back in the year 1000 guess
[00:09] what we would have to do if we wanted to
[00:11] share our knowledge in writing
[00:13] we have to write it on a papyrus piece
[00:14] of paper and physically give that one
[00:16] sheet of paper to one person
[00:18] that's it then gutenberg invented the
[00:20] printing press and now we can send books
[00:21] all over the place we can replicate a
[00:23] book
[00:23] and send it out to thousands of people
[00:25] instead of just one
[00:26] and then the internet came along and you
[00:28] can now just type something
[00:30] into twitter and it goes out to the
[00:31] world to potentially
[00:33] billions of people so this has been a
[00:35] really good thing for writers if you're
[00:37] a writer
[00:38] your circle of influence has expanded
[00:40] rapidly
[00:41] because of technology so instead of
[00:43] being afraid
[00:44] of technology taking your job you need
[00:46] to think how can i use technology to
[00:48] enhance and increase my reach and
[00:50] increase the amount of work i can do
[00:52] so i can make more money and have more
[00:54] of an influence so the next step in that
[00:56] is
[00:57] ai writing so in the past we have been
[01:00] writing stuff on a computer but the
[01:02] human has to think of what to write
[01:04] now with models like open ai gbt3
[01:07] we can kind of have the computer think
[01:10] for us a little bit
[01:11] so you still need a human to kind of put
[01:12] things together but
[01:14] we can now brainstorm much better with
[01:16] these copywriting ai tools
[01:18] we actually invited one of the founders
[01:20] of copy ai to
[01:21] tell us about gbt3 paul yacubi and
[01:24] welcome uh paul can you
[01:26] quickly explain to us what gbt3 has done
[01:29] and how you're using it
[01:31] sure so gpt3 is an ai model that
[01:34] predicts
[01:35] language and it's a model that was built
[01:37] by openai which is a
[01:39] for-profit startup that was uh launched
[01:42] a few years ago
[01:43] and one of the original backers was elon
[01:45] musk so their
[01:46] their main mission is to build like a
[01:48] thinking computer
[01:50] so really way out there in terms of
[01:53] techno
[01:54] technologically what's possible so they
[01:56] launched gpt2
[01:58] in 2019 which allowed allowed you to
[02:00] generate
[02:01] like auto complete text like lots of
[02:04] text
[02:05] and that was an open source release when
[02:07] we were
[02:08] playing around with that about one in
[02:10] ten results was pretty good
[02:11] and about one in a hundred was totally
[02:13] mind-blowing
[02:15] then in 2020 in the summer they launched
[02:17] gpt-3
[02:18] so instead of going to like you know
[02:21] let's make it twice as big or like 10
[02:23] times as big
[02:24] they made the model 100 times the size
[02:27] so they just like
[02:28] skipped a whole round of improvements
[02:31] and took it to like the double next
[02:33] level
[02:34] so if you were following any of this
[02:36] stuff on twitter you'd see these insane
[02:38] demos launching like
[02:39] describe an app and then you see this
[02:41] app get built right in front of your
[02:42] eyes and the computer does it all for
[02:44] you
[02:45] yeah just like what the hell is this
[02:47] like i enter in a
[02:48] five a five word description of a
[02:51] product and then like
[02:52] boom now i can generate all this copy
[02:55] like all this marketing material
[02:56] the way to think about what gpt3 is it's
[02:59] basically they downloaded like 10
[03:01] of the internet they just downloaded it
[03:04] and then they they basically said if
[03:06] this word comes after this one
[03:08] like what percentage of the time but
[03:10] they did it across like multiple
[03:12] compounding like word variations and
[03:15] strings
[03:16] and like there are 172 billion data
[03:19] parameters in this model it takes a
[03:21] super computer to run it
[03:23] so when you ask a question it's like a
[03:25] search query that says hey
[03:27] i would like blog post ideas and this is
[03:30] the topic
[03:31] well it's already it's already read all
[03:32] these blog posts so it knows roughly
[03:34] like it can give you original ideas and
[03:36] content just by
[03:38] synthesizing those results for you the
[03:40] way i've been using it lately is
[03:41] whenever i'm i mean look there's some
[03:43] times where i haven't had my coffee
[03:45] i'm kind of lazy in the morning and i
[03:47] can't come up with ideas you got the
[03:48] traditional kind of writer's block thing
[03:50] going on
[03:50] i spend things through copy ai i just
[03:52] like post random junk because it doesn't
[03:54] really matter
[03:55] and i put it into copy ai and it'll come
[03:57] up with actually some kind of like
[03:58] random ideas and i'll pick and choose
[03:59] from
[04:00] the results is that a common use case
[04:03] yeah i'd say number one would be
[04:05] brainstorming so you
[04:06] you know roughly what topic you want to
[04:08] write about but you don't have like a
[04:09] marketing angle or like a hook
[04:11] that you can think about and we have
[04:12] tools that can help you find those
[04:14] things really quickly
[04:16] so it's like i know roughly what i need
[04:18] to write about
[04:20] boom here are some examples like we have
[04:22] the introductions tool
[04:23] that will write that first paragraph for
[04:25] you that's extremely important like most
[04:27] people
[04:28] you know they they sit down with a blank
[04:30] piece of paper and they're like
[04:32] nothing is going through your head you
[04:33] know it's like this is
[04:35] this is not very easy of a task right so
[04:39] because this is like the internet it's
[04:40] like literally neville you're asking the
[04:42] internet which
[04:43] in the internet it's like this the
[04:44] combined human
[04:46] minds across the planet that's basically
[04:49] what the internet is
[04:50] so you're asking like this generic human
[04:53] for ideas and it has all the knowledge
[04:55] that google's got
[04:56] like that's this insanely powerful like
[04:59] we've never been able to talk
[05:00] to the internet in that way so this is
[05:03] copy ai
[05:03] a ai copywriting platform that uses gpt3
[05:07] and adds it to prompt so you can
[05:08] brainstorm generate product descriptions
[05:10] subject lines etc
[05:12] let's try it out so let's say we want to
[05:13] make a product description for our
[05:15] product but we're not really sure where
[05:16] to start
[05:17] so a cool thing about copy ai is you
[05:19] could just go and start brainstorming
[05:20] ideas
[05:21] so let's type in running dog
[05:24] leash and say this is a dog leash
[05:28] that you can run with with your hands
[05:31] free
[05:31] okay so that's not the greatest
[05:32] description in the world but let's just
[05:34] see what happens
[05:36] create and then it'll come up with a
[05:38] bunch of different descriptions some
[05:40] might be good
[05:40] some might be bad let's see the results
[05:42] and how they compare to a human
[05:44] so watch your dog freely and comfortably
[05:46] with this amazing retractable dog leash
[05:48] this is a running dog leash that you can
[05:49] comfortably use with your hands free so
[05:51] already this sounds pretty awesome right
[05:54] we didn't have to do
[05:55] anything and so the running leash is the
[05:57] first hands-free dog that
[05:58] allows you to do what you love most run
[06:00] with your dog so
[06:02] it's giving you different ways to
[06:03] position this product so what you can do
[06:05] is kind of pick and choose
[06:07] these different descriptions that you
[06:08] like or parts of it or angles
[06:10] and then create your own unique
[06:12] description with it
[06:14] the cool thing about an ai rider is that
[06:16] it's a computer it never gets tired and
[06:17] it's kind of stupid but it works
[06:19] really really hard so if you want more
[06:21] and you're not satisfied with the
[06:22] results just click make more and it'll
[06:25] just
[06:25] drum up more and it'll keep going
[06:27] endlessly endlessly endlessly so now
[06:29] let's say
[06:30] that we want to write an email about
[06:32] this running dog leash
[06:34] well we can't come up with the subject
[06:35] line because we haven't had our coffee
[06:37] in the morning yet
[06:38] so what we do just go to copy ai and
[06:40] type it in running dog leash just same
[06:42] thing
[06:42] and then create and let's see what it
[06:44] comes up with so your dog won't believe
[06:46] how far you can run with this leash
[06:47] running a dog with your leash in your
[06:48] hand this leash gives you hands-free dog
[06:50] walking
[06:50] so i actually like this one so i'm going
[06:52] to copy this one and that's going to be
[06:54] the one
[06:54] that i personally use for my subject
[06:56] line that simple
[06:58] so let's try writing some website copy
[07:00] for some of this stuff so let's type in
[07:02] blog
[07:02] ideas with the same thing and type in
[07:05] create
[07:05] and see what happens so instantly it'll
[07:08] come up with a bunch of ideas
[07:09] top five leashes for running with your
[07:10] pup the ultimate dog leash for runners
[07:12] jog a dog leash running with a dog leash
[07:15] dog leash for runners they blog about
[07:16] the benefits of dog leashes for active
[07:18] owners
[07:19] as you can see this comes up with ideas
[07:21] so fast so let's talk about some of the
[07:23] pros and cons of ai writing so
[07:25] one of the pros is that you always have
[07:27] this little idea generator
[07:29] that you can always use to come up with
[07:30] a bunch of ideas so if i go over here
[07:32] and type in growth ideas for a running
[07:34] dog leash
[07:35] it'll just come with with a bunch that i
[07:37] can then think can i do that one can i
[07:39] not do that one
[07:40] so let's take a look at the results that
[07:41] it provided over here so growth ideas
[07:43] for our running
[07:44] dog it said make a podcast about it okay
[07:47] interesting maybe not the best idea of
[07:48] right away but that's pretty cool
[07:50] let's see runny contest on social
[07:51] networks that rewards users for
[07:53] downloading and trying your running dog
[07:54] leash
[07:55] interesting how about create a story
[07:57] around it which encourages
[07:59] influencers to publish content so this
[08:01] is really
[08:02] taking a lot of examples and articles on
[08:05] the internet of how do you
[08:07] grow a business and it's applying it to
[08:09] our exact example
[08:10] how cool is that so that's one of the
[08:12] major pros
[08:14] of copy ai and gbt3 is that it can give
[08:17] you
[08:18] unlimited ideas that you can then run
[08:21] through your head
[08:22] and figure out which one to run with
[08:23] another major pro to
[08:25] writing with ai is that it comes up with
[08:28] creative ideas
[08:29] and creativity is just taking something
[08:31] from this realm
[08:32] and then taking something from this
[08:33] realm and smashing them together
[08:35] so if you work in the shipping industry
[08:37] and then you're also in the computer
[08:38] industry
[08:39] and you take something you learn from
[08:40] the shipping industry and apply it to
[08:41] the computer industry
[08:42] and you're like oh wow that's a new
[08:44] creative idea
[08:46] that's exactly what these ai writers do
[08:48] they take
[08:49] the entire breadth of the internet and
[08:51] apply different pieces of knowledge to
[08:53] different
[08:54] industries and that is creativity so you
[08:57] have this
[08:58] creative assistant that can help you
[09:00] with ideas
[09:01] amazing so let's talk about the cons of
[09:03] writing with ai
[09:05] so one of the cons that i found and i
[09:07] sign up to a ton of different services
[09:09] that do this
[09:10] is that the g whiz bang factor of the
[09:12] wow factor when you originally try
[09:14] writing with ai
[09:15] is unreal you're just like oh my god
[09:17] this is going to do everything
[09:18] the one problem with it is that once you
[09:20] actually start using it
[09:22] it is very helpful for generating ideas
[09:24] and it is going to be a part of a lot of
[09:26] writers lives from now on
[09:27] but it doesn't do everything for you
[09:30] exactly right
[09:31] yet that's the crazy part right now i
[09:34] can tell you some
[09:35] cons of writing with ai but by the time
[09:38] gpg
[09:39] 4 or 5 or 12 comes out will they have
[09:42] been solved
[09:43] maybe now the next generation of gpg3 is
[09:47] imagery so instead of just coming up
[09:48] with language things it can actually
[09:50] make
[09:51] images based off of what you say and
[09:53] this is actually working pretty well
[09:55] it's called dali
[09:56] and dali is basically something where
[09:59] you can say an armchair in the shape of
[10:00] an avocado
[10:01] and it just generates a ton more
[10:05] so look at that look how many avocado
[10:07] shaped arm chairs you can make
[10:09] instantaneously this used to be
[10:11] something i would have to go into
[10:12] photoshop
[10:13] learn photoshop figure out how to do it
[10:15] and i probably couldn't even make images
[10:16] of this quality and now you can say
[10:19] a couple of words and it instantly makes
[10:21] hundreds of images for you
[10:22] i mean this is pretty game changing the
[10:25] other thing that's a little bit of a
[10:26] hint of the future is like look how good
[10:28] some of these images are
[10:30] you type in a photo of food from china
[10:32] and it shows you all these photos
[10:34] um but here's the little twist that you
[10:36] may not know
[10:37] none of these photos are real these
[10:39] aren't real photos someone did not take
[10:40] these with their phone
[10:42] a food from china this is the ai
[10:45] completely 100 rendering each of these
[10:48] photos
[10:49] isn't that wild so imagine that you say
[10:52] a photo of alamo square san francisco
[10:54] from a street at night
[10:55] every single one of these is not a real
[10:57] picture it's a i
[10:58] generated based off of real pictures of
[11:00] course but you can make hundreds of
[11:02] iterations
[11:03] of what you think are real images that
[11:05] are completely generated the thing that
[11:07] i'm really excited about for gbt3
[11:09] and copy ai to come out with is dolly
[11:12] wherever you can
[11:13] start describing things that you write
[11:16] in an article
[11:17] so let's say i'm trying to describe
[11:18] three cubes of red cube is on top
[11:20] sitting on a green cube
[11:21] well guess what dali can just go through
[11:24] and actually make all these images for
[11:26] me
[11:26] i previously had to go out and get my
[11:28] ipad out and draw it and all that kind
[11:30] of stuff
[11:30] now you just describe it pick from the
[11:32] best images and stick it in your blog
[11:34] post
[11:35] that's pretty wild okay so let's
[11:38] summarize up
[11:38] so a lot of times i show this kind of
[11:40] stuff to writers and they're like is
[11:41] this going to take my job
[11:43] i mean this is what i do all day is this
[11:45] going to replace me
[11:46] and to an answer uh it'll replace some
[11:48] of your work
[11:49] yeah every time there's a new technology
[11:51] what happens is it doesn't necessarily
[11:53] replace the job that it's helping
[11:55] it actually assists the job so the
[11:57] people that are
[11:58] afraid of the new technology and resist
[12:00] it yeah they have some problems
[12:02] but the people that embrace this new
[12:04] technology they are the ones that
[12:05] succeed
[12:06] and are able to do their job for far
[12:08] more people so if you're only able
[12:11] to write for two three clients or a
[12:13] couple of your blog posts at a time
[12:15] well what if with ai you're able to
[12:18] write for 10 clients
[12:19] or write 20 blog posts at a time
[12:22] wouldn't that be better
[12:23] and ultimately writing is not
[12:25] necessarily about the act of writing
[12:27] it's usually trying to convey a point
[12:28] so for me i write for businesses all the
[12:31] time and if we're trying to get a
[12:33] business
[12:33] to sell stuff we don't want to spend a
[12:35] lot of time writing that's not the point
[12:37] the point is to promote the product to
[12:39] get it out there to show it to people to
[12:40] get people to buy it
[12:42] so if we can bypass a lot of the tedious
[12:44] writing
[12:45] and mind churning that happens whenever
[12:47] you're writing
[12:48] that's a great thing and these type of
[12:50] tools can really really help you

hey it's neville here and today i want to talk to you about something called ai writing now computers have been helping writers for ages if we were back in the year 1000 guess what we would have to do if we wanted to share our knowledge in writing we have to write it on a papyrus piece of paper and physically give that one sheet of paper to one person that's it then gutenberg invented the printing press and now we can send books all over the place we can replicate a book and send it out to thousands of people instead of just one and then the internet came along and you can now just type something into twitter and it goes out to the world to potentially billions of people so this has been a really good thing for writers if you're a writer your circle of influence has expanded rapidly because of technology so instead of being afraid of technology taking your job you need to think how can i use technology to enhance and increase my reach and increase the amount of work i can do so i can make more money and have more of an influence so the next step in that is ai writing so in the past we have been writing stuff on a computer but the human has to think of what to write now with models like open ai gbt3 we can kind of have the computer think for us a little bit so you still need a human to kind of put things together but we can now brainstorm much better with these copywriting ai tools we actually invited one of the founders of copy ai to tell us about gbt3 paul yacubi and welcome uh paul can you quickly explain to us what gbt3 has done and how you're using it sure so gpt3 is an ai model that predicts language and it's a model that was built by openai which is a for-profit startup that was uh launched a few years ago and one of the original backers was elon musk so their their main mission is to build like a thinking computer so really way out there in terms of techno technologically what's possible so they launched gpt2 in 2019 which allowed allowed you to generate like auto complete text like lots of text and that was an open source release when we were playing around with that about one in ten results was pretty good and about one in a hundred was totally mind-blowing then in 2020 in the summer they launched gpt-3 so instead of going to like you know let's make it twice as big or like 10 times as big they made the model 100 times the size so they just like skipped a whole round of improvements and took it to like the double next level so if you were following any of this stuff on twitter you'd see these insane demos launching like describe an app and then you see this app get built right in front of your eyes and the computer does it all for you yeah just like what the hell is this like i enter in a five a five word description of a product and then like boom now i can generate all this copy like all this marketing material the way to think about what gpt3 is it's basically they downloaded like 10 of the internet they just downloaded it and then they they basically said if this word comes after this one like what percentage of the time but they did it across like multiple compounding like word variations and strings and like there are 172 billion data parameters in this model it takes a super computer to run it so when you ask a question it's like a search query that says hey i would like blog post ideas and this is the topic well it's already it's already read all these blog posts so it knows roughly like it can give you original ideas and content just by synthesizing those results for you the way i've been using it lately is whenever i'm i mean look there's some times where i haven't had my coffee i'm kind of lazy in the morning and i can't come up with ideas you got the traditional kind of writer's block thing going on i spend things through copy ai i just like post random junk because it doesn't really matter and i put it into copy ai and it'll come up with actually some kind of like random ideas and i'll pick and choose from the results is that a common use case yeah i'd say number one would be brainstorming so you you know roughly what topic you want to write about but you don't have like a marketing angle or like a hook that you can think about and we have tools that can help you find those things really quickly so it's like i know roughly what i need to write about boom here are some examples like we have the introductions tool that will write that first paragraph for you that's extremely important like most people you know they they sit down with a blank piece of paper and they're like nothing is going through your head you know it's like this is this is not very easy of a task right so because this is like the internet it's like literally neville you're asking the internet which in the internet it's like this the combined human minds across the planet that's basically what the internet is so you're asking like this generic human for ideas and it has all the knowledge that google's got like that's this insanely powerful like we've never been able to talk to the internet in that way so this is copy ai a ai copywriting platform that uses gpt3 and adds it to prompt so you can brainstorm generate product descriptions subject lines etc let's try it out so let's say we want to make a product description for our product but we're not really sure where to start so a cool thing about copy ai is you could just go and start brainstorming ideas so let's type in running dog leash and say this is a dog leash that you can run with with your hands free okay so that's not the greatest description in the world but let's just see what happens create and then it'll come up with a bunch of different descriptions some might be good some might be bad let's see the results and how they compare to a human so watch your dog freely and comfortably with this amazing retractable dog leash this is a running dog leash that you can comfortably use with your hands free so already this sounds pretty awesome right we didn't have to do anything and so the running leash is the first hands-free dog that allows you to do what you love most run with your dog so it's giving you different ways to position this product so what you can do is kind of pick and choose these different descriptions that you like or parts of it or angles and then create your own unique description with it the cool thing about an ai rider is that it's a computer it never gets tired and it's kind of stupid but it works really really hard so if you want more and you're not satisfied with the results just click make more and it'll just drum up more and it'll keep going endlessly endlessly endlessly so now let's say that we want to write an email about this running dog leash well we can't come up with the subject line because we haven't had our coffee in the morning yet so what we do just go to copy ai and type it in running dog leash just same thing and then create and let's see what it comes up with so your dog won't believe how far you can run with this leash running a dog with your leash in your hand this leash gives you hands-free dog walking so i actually like this one so i'm going to copy this one and that's going to be the one that i personally use for my subject line that simple so let's try writing some website copy for some of this stuff so let's type in blog ideas with the same thing and type in create and see what happens so instantly it'll come up with a bunch of ideas top five leashes for running with your pup the ultimate dog leash for runners jog a dog leash running with a dog leash dog leash for runners they blog about the benefits of dog leashes for active owners as you can see this comes up with ideas so fast so let's talk about some of the pros and cons of ai writing so one of the pros is that you always have this little idea generator that you can always use to come up with a bunch of ideas so if i go over here and type in growth ideas for a running dog leash it'll just come with with a bunch that i can then think can i do that one can i not do that one so let's take a look at the results that it provided over here so growth ideas for our running dog it said make a podcast about it okay interesting maybe not the best idea of right away but that's pretty cool let's see runny contest on social networks that rewards users for downloading and trying your running dog leash interesting how about create a story around it which encourages influencers to publish content so this is really taking a lot of examples and articles on the internet of how do you grow a business and it's applying it to our exact example how cool is that so that's one of the major pros of copy ai and gbt3 is that it can give you unlimited ideas that you can then run through your head and figure out which one to run with another major pro to writing with ai is that it comes up with creative ideas and creativity is just taking something from this realm and then taking something from this realm and smashing them together so if you work in the shipping industry and then you're also in the computer industry and you take something you learn from the shipping industry and apply it to the computer industry and you're like oh wow that's a new creative idea that's exactly what these ai writers do they take the entire breadth of the internet and apply different pieces of knowledge to different industries and that is creativity so you have this creative assistant that can help you with ideas amazing so let's talk about the cons of writing with ai so one of the cons that i found and i sign up to a ton of different services that do this is that the g whiz bang factor of the wow factor when you originally try writing with ai is unreal you're just like oh my god this is going to do everything the one problem with it is that once you actually start using it it is very helpful for generating ideas and it is going to be a part of a lot of writers lives from now on but it doesn't do everything for you exactly right yet that's the crazy part right now i can tell you some cons of writing with ai but by the time gpg 4 or 5 or 12 comes out will they have been solved maybe now the next generation of gpg3 is imagery so instead of just coming up with language things it can actually make images based off of what you say and this is actually working pretty well it's called dali and dali is basically something where you can say an armchair in the shape of an avocado and it just generates a ton more so look at that look how many avocado shaped arm chairs you can make instantaneously this used to be something i would have to go into photoshop learn photoshop figure out how to do it and i probably couldn't even make images of this quality and now you can say a couple of words and it instantly makes hundreds of images for you i mean this is pretty game changing the other thing that's a little bit of a hint of the future is like look how good some of these images are you type in a photo of food from china and it shows you all these photos um but here's the little twist that you may not know none of these photos are real these aren't real photos someone did not take these with their phone a food from china this is the ai completely 100 rendering each of these photos isn't that wild so imagine that you say a photo of alamo square san francisco from a street at night every single one of these is not a real picture it's a i generated based off of real pictures of course but you can make hundreds of iterations of what you think are real images that are completely generated the thing that i'm really excited about for gbt3 and copy ai to come out with is dolly wherever you can start describing things that you write in an article so let's say i'm trying to describe three cubes of red cube is on top sitting on a green cube well guess what dali can just go through and actually make all these images for me i previously had to go out and get my ipad out and draw it and all that kind of stuff now you just describe it pick from the best images and stick it in your blog post that's pretty wild okay so let's summarize up so a lot of times i show this kind of stuff to writers and they're like is this going to take my job i mean this is what i do all day is this going to replace me and to an answer uh it'll replace some of your work yeah every time there's a new technology what happens is it doesn't necessarily replace the job that it's helping it actually assists the job so the people that are afraid of the new technology and resist it yeah they have some problems but the people that embrace this new technology they are the ones that succeed and are able to do their job for far more people so if you're only able to write for two three clients or a couple of your blog posts at a time well what if with ai you're able to write for 10 clients or write 20 blog posts at a time wouldn't that be better and ultimately writing is not necessarily about the act of writing it's usually trying to convey a point so for me i write for businesses all the time and if we're trying to get a business to sell stuff we don't want to spend a lot of time writing that's not the point the point is to promote the product to get it out there to show it to people to get people to buy it so if we can bypass a lot of the tedious writing and mind churning that happens whenever you're writing that's a great thing and these type of tools can really really help you hey did you like that video if you did and you
