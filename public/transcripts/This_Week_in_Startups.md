## Transcript with Timestamps

[00:00] hey everybody hey everybody we all know
[00:02] the AI space is moving at a blistering
[00:06] Pace right now so we decided to do a
[00:07] little ad hoc mini series on it we're
[00:10] calling it innovators in AI very
[00:12] creative every week I'm going to
[00:13] interview a Founder in the AI space here
[00:15] on this weekend startups and every
[00:17] founder that joins is going to be
[00:19] building something awesome that is the
[00:21] criteria we don't want just
[00:22] pontification we want to actually see
[00:24] real products and today we have the CEO
[00:28] of copy AI Paul yacubian we have a great
[00:31] conversation about the insane pace of AI
[00:34] as I mentioned and building products for
[00:36] a specific niche in this case writing
[00:39] copy AI right they do writing on top of
[00:42] various llms and he explains how he's
[00:45] dealing with the fact that hey he
[00:48] started I think with GPT two or three
[00:49] then they went 3.545 is coming out Bard
[00:53] is coming out from Google so many
[00:55] different llms out there how do you
[00:57] actually build a product that people are
[00:59] willing to to pay for when these core
[01:01] platforms are moving so fast that
[01:03] they're going to absorb the Innovations
[01:05] of people building on top of them almost
[01:08] in real time this is a major issue for
[01:11] Founders who are building in GPT or in
[01:16] AI with open ai's products so it's going
[01:18] to be a great and insightful episode
[01:20] please stick with us this week in
[01:22] startups is brought to you by Mercury

[02:35] today
[02:38] all right everybody next up on the
[02:39] program
[02:40] is a company that's been doing
[02:42] generative AI
[02:44] specifically in copy and words
[02:47] for a couple of years I met Paul a
[02:49] couple years ago when he was raising
[02:50] money for copy dot AI my bestie David
[02:53] sacks from craftventures is an investor
[02:55] in the company and I remember
[02:57] meeting you Paul and Paul's last name is
[03:00] Jacobian or you could be in rent that's
[03:03] right that's right here you go yeah
[03:05] um you I remember were working on a
[03:08] couple of experiments when we met one of
[03:10] them was like doing tag lines
[03:13] for users
[03:15] I don't know if you were using chat GPT
[03:16] at that point but when did you first
[03:18] become aware of chat GPT and or
[03:21] generative AI for copy good question so
[03:24] I started using gpt2 in the end of 2019
[03:27] and we were using it to create startup
[03:30] ideas so we were it was insanely
[03:32] creative but it was really bad at
[03:34] telling the truth because it wasn't
[03:36] trained on as much data as gpt3 was
[03:39] and it was immediately clear that the
[03:42] creative power was where the value
[03:44] driver would come from with the
[03:46] generative AI models and I thought it'd
[03:49] be seven years away from being
[03:51] commercially viable because it would
[03:53] just make stuff up and you had to really
[03:54] help like constrain the outputs of it to
[03:57] drive value from it
[03:59] um so I was creating science fictional
[04:01] products and just like had this
[04:03] explosion of ideas
[04:04] what was the interface like for that
[04:06] Chet gpt2 at the time was it all like a
[04:08] Dev tool because I remember it was a lot
[04:10] of startups were trying to get access to
[04:12] it yeah
[04:14] wasn't really available
[04:17] it was actually open source so you
[04:20] somebody had to set up the model host it
[04:22] and then build the UI for it and the the
[04:25] simplest UI was really just a text box
[04:27] where you would type something in and
[04:28] then just click a button and it would
[04:30] auto complete it for you and so I was
[04:32] using that but I wanted a lot of ideas
[04:34] and so I kept hitting the button and
[04:36] then deleting what it printed out and
[04:38] then hit it again and I was like a
[04:40] search interface would make way more
[04:42] sense like a ux interface for
[04:44] brainstorming and so I thought it would
[04:47] be about seven years before the model
[04:48] would actually be good enough because
[04:49] only about 10 of the results even made
[04:52] sense at that time with gpd2
[04:55] and then fast forward until uh July of
[04:57] 2020
[04:59] which is only like six months later and
[05:01] they launched EBT through which is 100
[05:03] times the size of gpt2 and that all the
[05:07] numbers flipped so all of a sudden most
[05:09] of the time it was making sense what was
[05:11] coming out ah and so when you we're
[05:15] doing 2.0 it was really interesting to
[05:17] look at the history of it I'm sure
[05:19] people are going to study this rapid
[05:21] Pace that this has gone on you there was
[05:24] no web-based service there's no
[05:25] cloud-based service you had to download
[05:27] it and then did you have to provide a
[05:29] model or was there already some training
[05:31] in it based on some model yeah they had
[05:34] pre-trained it and they had open sourced
[05:36] the model so somebody else ended up
[05:38] hosting it and providing that interface
[05:40] got it and so that's what I was using it
[05:42] were they upfront about what was in the
[05:44] model or did they just say hey we
[05:46] trained it on some stuff
[05:48] um or were they explicit hey we
[05:49] downloaded the Wikipedia hey we did
[05:51] quora hey we did Reddit with a at that
[05:53] time because that's something that I've
[05:54] been trying to get my head around and
[05:56] hopefully you can educate Us in the
[05:57] audiences to what what exactly how do
[06:01] you know what's been it's been trained
[06:02] on yeah they they I think in the paper
[06:05] listed out a number of the sources one
[06:07] is a common crawl data set it's just a
[06:09] huge huge file that's open source you
[06:11] can download it and you can use that to
[06:13] train the model Wikipedia was a big a
[06:16] big component crawl that's in a common
[06:18] crawl of open web so a bunch of web
[06:20] pages that are in an open source search
[06:23] engine of sorts that's right they got
[06:25] Reddit and I don't think they got quora
[06:26] at that time I think yeah probably had a
[06:29] paywall or something or a registration
[06:31] wall so they couldn't get in there right
[06:34] I think since then they have they have
[06:36] probably gotten access somehow to courts
[06:39] data set so you see 3.0 and it goes from
[06:41] one in ten times to getting it right to
[06:43] one in ten times getting it wrong
[06:45] yes another way nine and ten times dude
[06:47] at least making sense like it wasn't
[06:49] completely
[06:50] gobbling up gibberish exactly yeah so
[06:54] the first the first thing that came to
[06:55] my mind was like this is the next big
[06:57] wave and Tech because all that you have
[07:00] all these new use cases that are
[07:02] unlocked and we would I thought we would
[07:03] see you know immediately I've tweeted
[07:06] this out I thought it was a phase change
[07:08] of the internet
[07:09] so this is the first time the internet
[07:10] me trained and synthesized into a model
[07:12] and then talk back to you directly right
[07:15] so that's a profound change in the
[07:18] amount of information that you have
[07:19] access to at any any moment in time
[07:22] and given that you're kind of able to
[07:25] talk to the internet I thought the
[07:27] conversational interfaces would be the
[07:29] most relevant way to access that
[07:31] information that's in inside the models
[07:34] so we built built a slack bot and we
[07:37] asked uh openai if we could launch it
[07:40] and their safety team said no you can't
[07:42] launch that it's too dangerous and so we
[07:46] had to go back to the drawing board and
[07:48] we built
[07:49] um built the
[07:51] an app that could just summarize
[07:53] whatever you threw at it so we launched
[07:55] that we got a mention and the uh Wall
[07:59] Street Journal
[08:00] um for that and then we realized you
[08:03] know people that's like a sometimes use
[08:05] case I mean that is a component of of a
[08:08] skill that the AI models have but that's
[08:10] not something that people will subscribe
[08:12] for and pay us money every month
[08:16] listen as a Founder ensuring your cash
[08:18] is safe is priority number one it's been
[08:20] a bit crazy out there I don't want to
[08:21] put caps locks on right now but I will
[08:23] if you need me to the FDIC 250 000 limit
[08:27] is just not enough for most businesses
[08:29] so let me tell you about Mercury through
[08:31] its partner Banks and sweep Network
[08:33] Mercury customers can access up to five
[08:37] Milli five million in FDIC Insurance
[08:40] that's 20 times the per Bank limit
[08:43] sounds a lot safer doesn't it well these
[08:46] sweep networks protect your deposits by
[08:48] spreading them across multiple Banks
[08:50] which limits the risk of any single
[08:52] point of failure and with Mercury Vault
[08:55] any funds above the FDIC limit can
[08:57] easily be invested in a money market
[08:59] fund mostly comprised of U.S
[09:02] government-backed security so it's easy
[09:04] to get started with opening an account
[09:07] you can apply at minutes and many
[09:09] customers are approved and onboarded in
[09:11] less than two hours Mercury also offers
[09:13] great resources for Founders including
[09:15] my favorite raise this program connects
[09:18] founders with investors to help them
[09:20] raise funds head to mercury.com to join
[09:21] more than a hundred thousand startups
[09:23] that trust Mercury for Banking and if
[09:26] you're interested in Mercury Rays
[09:27] applications for both seed and series a
[09:30] are open through April 20 right so you
[09:34] got to get it in there by April 20th
[09:35] Mercury is a financial technology
[09:38] company not a bank banking services are
[09:40] provided by Choice Financial Group and
[09:42] evolve Bank and Trust members FDIC when
[09:46] it's summarizing something explain to a
[09:49] lay person
[09:50] what it's actually doing so you have a
[09:52] paragraph
[09:53] let's say you have uh I don't know a
[09:56] movie review from The New York Times
[09:58] it's a thousand words about some you
[10:00] know really detailed movie like tar
[10:02] right Academy Award uh uh
[10:04] oscar-nominated best picture what what
[10:06] does it do what is the what is the
[10:10] um what is the model actually doing when
[10:12] it is summarizing
[10:15] so there there are different techniques
[10:17] for summarization for these models
[10:21] um you know based on neural networks the
[10:24] neural net is learning skills so it is
[10:27] it has learned skills that you'd have
[10:30] otherwise needed specialty natural
[10:32] language processing algorithms to do
[10:35] and that's really what sets it apart so
[10:37] when you had 176 billion parameters in
[10:40] the model and they're structured into
[10:42] layers these layers get really good at
[10:45] doing certain things and for the
[10:47] summarization tasks
[10:49] it can learn you know what summarization
[10:51] means like what does the word mean to
[10:53] summarize something you can pick that up
[10:55] from the Corpus that it's trained on so
[10:56] that all the text that it's trained on
[10:58] and then that is a task it can do it can
[11:01] do pretty well which which to me I was
[11:03] like okay now this one model we can use
[11:06] to do all of these natural language
[11:08] processing tasks without needing a bunch
[11:11] of NLP Engineers on the team it's
[11:15] literally one API call and I can just
[11:16] prompt it in natural language and tell
[11:18] it what I want and it'll give that back
[11:20] to me so the the first thousand major
[11:23] unlock because it suddenly made the
[11:25] process of building an MVP a software
[11:28] MVP that uses natural language
[11:30] technology
[11:33] um made that really easy so you could
[11:35] build a prototype and launch it
[11:37] and so when we built our next uh
[11:39] prototype it was called taglines.a it
[11:42] was just a tagline generator that took
[11:45] 48 hours from beginning to end to build
[11:47] the entire thing
[11:49] and we launched it 48 hours after saying
[11:52] okay maybe people would buy you know
[11:54] maybe marketers would buy words if we
[11:56] can generate them
[11:57] and So within the first week we had
[11:59] validated that not only would you have
[12:00] professional copywriters using these
[12:02] tools but you'd have marketers and
[12:04] Freelancers and small business owners
[12:06] students it's like that was a huge
[12:08] validation of the market size and the
[12:11] tan potential because it was such a wide
[12:13] user base
[12:14] and then we also validated that people
[12:17] would use a tagline generator to do like
[12:20] email subject lines headers for websites
[12:24] um just all kind of like PowerPoint
[12:26] slide you know titles
[12:29] um and really validated that the number
[12:31] of use cases were really wide for that
[12:34] as well and then threw up like a stripe
[12:37] paywall
[12:39] and then validated people would sign up
[12:40] for a subscription so we started
[12:42] charging
[12:43] three dollars a month we got some
[12:45] subscribers raise it to six and then
[12:47] raise it to ten and we continue to get
[12:49] subscribers coming in so at that point
[12:51] we validated one that it was
[12:53] commercially viable that you had a wide
[12:55] market and a wide set of use cases right
[12:58] and that makes sense there are copy
[13:00] editors in the world you discovered this
[13:03] is working nine out of ten times and if
[13:05] you could make that more efficient for
[13:07] ten dollars a month if they the average
[13:09] copywriter I think freelance probably
[13:10] gets paid 50 bucks an hour 40 bucks an
[13:12] hour 60 bucks an hour so in that range I
[13:14] mean it's not even one hour of their
[13:16] time so that's always one of those great
[13:19] tools for Founders is to say what does
[13:21] this person get paid an hour okay this
[13:22] attorney gets paid a thousand dollars an
[13:23] hour
[13:24] save them one hour a month they'll pay
[13:26] you a thousand dollars or they'll be
[13:28] okay with it right
[13:29] exactly so when we went through that
[13:32] exercise it was really clear that from
[13:34] all the way from a student to
[13:36] professional would find Value in these
[13:38] AI models and then the thing that we
[13:40] learned from going from two to three was
[13:43] that if you throw more data at it it's
[13:44] going to get even better and better at
[13:46] performing these tasks at an expert
[13:48] level or Beyond so now when we get to
[13:51] gpt4 to get back to this sort of these
[13:53] jumps it was three I think there was
[13:55] three point five and four in terms of
[13:57] major releases you're working directly
[13:59] with the open AI team you have some
[14:01] Insider access to it I understand so you
[14:04] were kind of in touch with them and and
[14:06] seeing what was coming what was coming
[14:08] between three and three point five and
[14:09] three point five and four
[14:11] yeah so for 3.5 they ended up tuning it
[14:14] to human feedback and so what what that
[14:18] would do is it would allow you to to
[14:19] kind of describe the intent that you had
[14:22] and you wouldn't have to prompt it with
[14:23] examples as much so when we first built
[14:26] our tools each tool you had to give an
[14:28] examples of what good looks like and you
[14:30] had to make sure that even the examples
[14:32] are very diverse when they ended up
[14:35] fine-tuning it on human feedback they
[14:37] kind of programmed that in across a wide
[14:39] variety of use cases and so that enabled
[14:42] the chat GPT experience where you can
[14:45] just tell it what you want and it'll
[14:47] figure out and actually create that
[14:49] content that you want
[14:51] uh and so when you saw three 3.54 maybe
[14:54] you could describe for the audience yeah
[14:56] the the step functions there you said
[14:57] before hey you know it's right one out
[14:59] of ten times then it's right nine out of
[15:01] ten times now let's go to 3.5 and 4. 3.5
[15:04] yeah it was awesome it was like a big a
[15:07] big leap and a lot of the complexity and
[15:10] prompting it kind of went away a lot of
[15:13] um even the use cases for more
[15:15] fine-tuning of models so
[15:18] um you'll see a lot of startups talk
[15:20] about how valuable they're they're
[15:22] fine-tuned models are like oh we have
[15:24] proprietary models well at the end of
[15:26] the day not there aren't that many
[15:28] models that are really relevant for for
[15:31] you to have fine to explain what the
[15:33] model is again to a layperson and what's
[15:36] an incredible example of that where
[15:37] you're restricting it
[15:39] and building a model that maybe results
[15:41] in better output
[15:44] yeah so the
[15:46] these are foundational models so these
[15:48] are built to be general purpose that
[15:50] means they can do a lot of things at you
[15:53] know are pretty pretty solid rate what
[15:55] they figured out was that the general
[15:57] purpose model could actually outperform
[16:00] specialized models if they kind of made
[16:03] them bigger
[16:04] um and train it on more data and that is
[16:08] nuts that's nuts so I don't know if
[16:10] you've seen some of the gpt4 metrics but
[16:13] they've they said oh well it passed the
[16:14] bar exam it passed like these all these
[16:17] examples right it's getting better
[16:18] across every single category so that's
[16:21] measurement pause on that for a second
[16:23] yeah you used to build in the industry
[16:26] what was called narrow AI yes narrow
[16:29] learning so hey we're going to learn how
[16:31] to beat
[16:33] um you know humans at poker chess go
[16:36] you know pick a video game fortnite and
[16:39] we'll really just work in that narrow
[16:41] subject area now this more General model
[16:46] um
[16:46] a little confusing to use the word
[16:48] General because it's loaded because
[16:49] there's General AI as a concept which is
[16:51] thinking like a human but they are
[16:53] average or their default model maybe is
[16:55] a better word for their default model
[16:57] is better
[16:59] at doing the lstat or the SATs
[17:03] or the bar exam then a model that was
[17:06] trained just to do the bar exam that's
[17:07] what we're they're learning with four
[17:09] that's right
[17:11] and you seem to say hey that's insane
[17:13] why is that insane
[17:15] why is that insane
[17:16] uh it really does
[17:19] level the playing field if you have
[17:21] access to those the gpt4 model so you
[17:25] don't need a whole team of AI Engineers
[17:26] who don't need a whole team of machine
[17:27] learning Engineers you can actually
[17:29] build you can just go straight into
[17:31] building the application
[17:35] I was going to say something that I
[17:37] think larger companies are running into
[17:40] issues around is they've kind of
[17:41] delegated the like hey AI team go figure
[17:45] out this generative AI stuff
[17:47] but
[17:49] the AI team you know the AI team comes
[17:52] back and says you know what we can't
[17:53] beat GPT three and a half we can't beat
[17:55] gpt4
[17:57] they'll get fired right
[17:59] right
[18:00] that's fascinating so if I was working
[18:03] inside of I don't know Amazon would you
[18:06] say Walmart and I said hey our internal
[18:09] teams is a great example Amazon's a
[18:11] great example yeah I'm in Amazon I want
[18:13] to optimize Amazon Prime members to show
[18:17] them better reviews and show them better
[18:19] q a so take the Q a section on an Amazon
[18:22] page in the review section and we'll
[18:24] summarize it and make it better for
[18:26] users
[18:27] if GPT 4 can do that better than the
[18:30] internal team
[18:32] well why is there even an internal team
[18:36] yeah that's pretty wild depends on the
[18:39] use case so if you looked at like the
[18:41] iPhone voicemail system you know try to
[18:43] transcribe a voicemail message
[18:46] they had I don't have any thousand AI
[18:48] engineers at Apple and then openai had a
[18:51] team of I think two or three people then
[18:54] figured out how to how to complete the
[18:57] um Voice to Text task
[19:00] and they ended up launching a model
[19:02] called whisper and they open sourced it
[19:04] they literally gave away the technology
[19:05] and it dramatically outperformed all of
[19:09] the existing Technologies all of it
[19:14] all right everybody our friends from
[19:16] Microsoft are here Tom Davis a senior
[19:18] director at Microsoft for startups and
[19:20] you're a former founder you are here
[19:22] today to talk to us about the giant
[19:25] leaps that Microsoft has made in the AI
[19:27] space what does this mean for startups I
[19:31] see a ton of different tools I've been
[19:32] playing with chat TPT for I have a paid
[19:35] account but I'm also seeing things
[19:37] happen with GitHub absolutely so uh the
[19:40] work that we've been doing with open AI
[19:43] over the last few years has really set
[19:45] ourselves up with a foundation around uh
[19:48] we've built this sort of AI super
[19:50] computer from the ground up and we've
[19:53] been looked at everything from GPU
[19:55] configurations to networking and things
[19:57] and really what we're now able to do is
[20:00] sort of allow startups to access all of
[20:03] this Innovation through our Founders Hub
[20:05] so we've been building this just do
[20:07] something at scale so startups can now
[20:09] build their own AI applications and and
[20:12] build out and train llms as well and
[20:15] this has really helped us to become a
[20:17] far better Cloud for AI broadly and
[20:21] being able to drive that down to the
[20:22] startup ecosystem is fantastic it's open
[20:25] to everybody there's no funding
[20:26] requirement you don't have to be
[20:27] anointed by a VC five minutes to sign up
[20:30] you get six figures of benefits Azure
[20:32] credits GitHub open AI apis which
[20:34] everybody's really having fun playing
[20:36] with and so much more so go ahead and
[20:38] sign up right now AKA dot Ms slash this
[20:40] week in startups AKA dot MS
[20:42] slash this week in startups thanks so
[20:45] much Tom thank you
[20:47] so
[20:48] as we're looking at this yeah
[20:52] this is almost like the snake is eating
[20:54] its own towel kind of situation
[20:56] we're all going you know
[20:58] uh copywriters your name of your
[21:01] company's copy AI you got 12 million
[21:02] dollars in reoccurring revenue and your
[21:05] premise which turned out to be
[21:06] absolutely correct is hey this thing is
[21:07] advancing fast copywriters are going to
[21:10] use this tool to be willing to pay for
[21:12] it's going to make them bionic make them
[21:13] superhuman
[21:15] um we'll replace them but might replace
[21:16] the bottom third that are terrible at
[21:19] their jobs or make the bottom third
[21:20] great at their jobs or good at their
[21:22] jobs was that your central tenant
[21:25] um about this because the replacing of a
[21:27] job or elimination of the job in other
[21:29] words I'm the developer or I'm the CEO
[21:31] I'll just ask chatgpt for copy and I
[21:34] don't need a copy editor uh what what is
[21:36] your belief now let's take copy editing
[21:38] your wheelhouse is copy editing gonna go
[21:41] away and the CEO or the sales team just
[21:43] does the cop asked chappy T to do it or
[21:45] will there be bionic copywriters who use
[21:48] this as a starting point
[21:50] I think before you know before we launch
[21:52] copy I had no idea what copywriters even
[21:54] did
[21:56] so it was it was never about copywriting
[21:58] it was that was basically the first use
[22:00] case that I thought would be relatively
[22:03] translatable
[22:05] against the models but the thing that
[22:07] really motivates me and my co-founder is
[22:09] the idea that people have great like a
[22:12] high degree of creativity especially
[22:14] kids yeah they're super creative I've
[22:16] got two daughters that are extremely
[22:18] creative
[22:19] and then they we pre-train them
[22:22] through school right just like these
[22:25] models are now pre-trained on the
[22:26] internet
[22:28] and all that pre-training kind of stamps
[22:31] out the creativity
[22:32] and by the time they graduate
[22:35] they're very tracked in the things that
[22:37] they want to do yeah so it's like oh I'm
[22:39] going to be an attorney or I'm going to
[22:40] be an accountant or I'm going to be a
[22:42] software engineer
[22:43] and I think that that whole process is
[22:47] going to come to an end here because
[22:50] gpt4 can do all of the liberal arts
[22:53] better than any expert could
[22:56] right and now that's a tool that's in
[22:58] your pocket which means we don't need to
[23:01] train people on a lot of these very
[23:04] technical tasks that we used to because
[23:07] we've now trained computers to do that
[23:09] repeatedly
[23:10] so there will be a very uh you know a
[23:14] challenging transition for a lot of
[23:16] Industries a lot of Institutions like
[23:18] higher education education in general
[23:21] and we're gonna have to figure out okay
[23:22] what what's the best use of of a
[23:25] person's time well that that usually
[23:28] comes down to the individual
[23:30] and what we what I'm seeing you know the
[23:32] whole my whole hope here is that people
[23:34] can be way more creative
[23:37] because each time they are creative they
[23:39] have an outlet to actually build
[23:41] something they can actually get things
[23:42] done so a non-copyrighter a non-writer
[23:45] somebody's just not good at words can
[23:47] now go in there and be good at words so
[23:49] you take these exactly 80 of people who
[23:51] are not good at that now they can be
[23:53] good at it I may not be good at drawing
[23:55] or illustrating but I can pop up stable
[23:57] diffusion or any number of tools and I
[24:00] could be a good illustrator so now
[24:01] you've got the 99 of people who have no
[24:04] illustration skill can't draw for not uh
[24:08] and they can be creative so it's not
[24:10] that that everybody's job goes away it's
[24:12] that everybody gets good at everybody's
[24:14] job
[24:15] yes
[24:16] that's an interesting way to look at it
[24:18] right and that's that's incredibly
[24:19] powerful especially if when you're
[24:22] looking at entrepreneurship so there if
[24:25] you've ever tried to create your own
[24:26] website for example that takes a lot of
[24:28] time and it can be very stressful for
[24:30] somebody that's trying to get something
[24:32] off the ground
[24:33] that is now you know going to be pretty
[24:35] much instantaneous like oh I need a
[24:37] website boom I've got one yeah I need I
[24:40] need a presentation
[24:41] boom you know I can just generate a
[24:43] whole like my old deck
[24:46] um
[24:49] yeah and so which happens now you can go
[24:52] on Squarespace pick a template and now
[24:56] you'd be able to a future version of
[24:58] Squarespace will be hey make me a
[24:59] website and show me five different
[25:01] designs I need one that's funkier I need
[25:03] one that's a little more avant-garde
[25:06] um
[25:06] the challenge is what kind of business
[25:10] are you going to create that's gonna
[25:12] actually be able to compete against what
[25:15] the AI models can do
[25:17] yeah
[25:18] well and
[25:20] to your point the AI developers who are
[25:24] making this are literally working
[25:26] themselves out of a job the better they
[25:28] do the less they're needed
[25:30] because the general model can do better
[25:32] than the specific model so at least in
[25:34] that case the narrow specific models are
[25:37] being subsumed into the general models
[25:38] yes yeah you're seeing that and then
[25:40] you're also seeing it
[25:42] um in the software itself so I'll give
[25:44] you kind of a run through here so yeah
[25:47] software is why is software valuable
[25:49] Jason
[25:51] uh because it makes people more
[25:53] efficient which means it reduces the
[25:55] cost of any good or service
[25:58] right and and what like why software is
[26:02] valuable is because it's reusable so
[26:04] your investment to build a big part of
[26:06] it yeah right it's a reusability
[26:08] so we're now heading in a into a world
[26:11] where software can be generated on the
[26:13] Fly
[26:14] right and it's almost the cost of
[26:16] creating new software is going to zero
[26:18] hmm
[26:20] right that means that the Returns on
[26:22] investing in that software
[26:25] should also go to zero
[26:27] which causes
[26:29] some problems in the Venture Capital
[26:31] Community I'm an angel investor yeah
[26:34] yeah you're an angel investor
[26:36] um so we really
[26:38] this whole thing is going to get
[26:40] transformed from a technology standpoint
[26:42] fantastic I mean if you can build a
[26:45] company with two people instead of ten
[26:47] or ten people instead of 30
[26:49] well that means you need less investment
[26:51] in the earliest investors are the only
[26:53] ones who get to seat at the table I'm
[26:55] fine with that I'm fine with people who
[26:56] do serious B and C is getting blocked
[26:58] from having an opportunity to invest
[27:01] because the company's too profitable is
[27:03] that sort of your premise it takes less
[27:04] money to run this just like cloud
[27:05] computing drop the cost of it
[27:07] yeah so when it should expand the number
[27:09] of people that can build things which
[27:11] should be good overall for
[27:13] entrepreneurship uh two like you said on
[27:16] the growth stages that's that's going to
[27:18] increasingly make I think a little bit
[27:20] less sense and you've seen you saw YC
[27:22] shut down the continuity fund and which
[27:24] is their growth stage fund uh this week
[27:27] and
[27:28] and so in that and then when we look at
[27:31] the AI landscape
[27:33] a lot of the repeatable tasks are in the
[27:37] sales and marketing space
[27:39] so like personalization now can be done
[27:41] on a one-to-one basis
[27:43] um at scale even things like querying
[27:47] databases you know that's something that
[27:49] people had to do on their own so you'd
[27:51] have to figure out well how do I write
[27:54] the right search query to get the right
[27:56] results maybe on LinkedIn
[27:58] um so what what you're going to see
[28:00] happen in this uh you know chat is a
[28:04] great example of this
[28:06] we'll Express intent right which is what
[28:08] our query is when we type into chat and
[28:11] then the AI will like figure out what it
[28:14] needs to go do to get us back what we're
[28:17] looking for
[28:18] and so that that is a world of AI agents
[28:22] where we're letting the AI go and do
[28:24] things for us
[28:25] and that world looks very different as
[28:27] well so AI doesn't need an interface to
[28:31] go grab data right it can just query
[28:33] apis directly and go get the information
[28:35] it needs if it's allowed to if it has
[28:38] access to it exactly so I had a tweet
[28:41] about this I said the biggest by the end
[28:43] of the year is my prediction the biggest
[28:45] search engine on the planet won't be
[28:46] Google it'll be Bing
[28:48] and it won't be because people are using
[28:50] it's because the Bots are using it
[28:53] so so many Bots are doing queries that
[28:56] it's just going to increase the size of
[28:57] the Corpus and the learning model the
[29:00] Corpus the Corpus uh kind of grows when
[29:03] you publish things and so there are
[29:06] going to be you know agent flows and Bot
[29:08] flows that go and create more content
[29:10] and new content
[29:12] um but for the on the retrieval side
[29:14] that a lot of those queries are going to
[29:16] get sucked in to you know powering some
[29:19] result right and then that result gets
[29:22] re-indexed it gets re-indexed and now
[29:24] people are speculating it's going to
[29:25] pollute the search indexes to the point
[29:28] of absurdity somebody like yourself
[29:31] or some group of people offshore uh just
[29:34] like they created content Farms they
[29:36] could literally just start creating
[29:38] they could create an AI right now with
[29:40] chatgpt that registers 100 new domains a
[29:43] day
[29:44] makes a hundred different recipes and
[29:47] then articles about those recipes and
[29:49] then does the same thing every day until
[29:51] there are so many recipe sites that the
[29:54] internet is flooded with garbage and
[29:55] nobody knows which one actually works
[29:59] yeah Google kind of knows Google knows
[30:03] well they have they have the original
[30:04] index I have yeah and they they can
[30:08] detect AI generate content overall
[30:10] they're how do they do that how do they
[30:12] generate how do they know it's
[30:14] um chat GPT generated
[30:16] there are signatures in the outputs that
[30:20] that allow you to calculate
[30:22] um it's a perplexity score sometimes and
[30:25] that's that's an actual measurement of
[30:27] How likely the next word is is to follow
[30:30] the previous one got it so it's too
[30:32] perfect
[30:34] and you can you can like make it not be
[30:37] as perfect just by giving it certain
[30:39] instructions and say
[30:40] mix it up a little bit I think this is
[30:42] how they they caught the chess cheater
[30:45] kid was he was doing the book move yes
[30:48] he was like accurate yeah how often does
[30:53] somebody do the book move and I play in
[30:55] the chest.com thing and it will tell you
[30:57] like this is the book move this is the
[30:59] you know game very optimal move
[31:02] basically and if everybody's doing game
[31:04] very optimal so now you have to put
[31:05] something in a randomized to not do game
[31:06] very optimal so maybe at some point it
[31:08] figures that out you know what's
[31:09] interesting though
[31:11] they said when the digital camera came
[31:13] out
[31:14] uh that this would change Hollywood
[31:15] Forever
[31:16] that
[31:18] digital filmmakers and Wayne Wang did a
[31:21] digital film
[31:23] um and Bennett Miller had done a digital
[31:25] film on this is all on the VX 1000 I
[31:28] believe was the name of the Sony camera
[31:29] one yeah it became super popular in the
[31:32] late 90s in New York and all these and
[31:33] skateboarding and skateboarding yes well
[31:36] skateboarders use it right yeah and it
[31:38] was like this thing is so good that when
[31:40] you blow it up and you put it on a
[31:42] projector you can't kind of tell or most
[31:44] audiences can't tell a cinematographer
[31:45] obviously could and then there were
[31:47] filters in you know different pieces of
[31:49] software that would make it look even
[31:50] better anyway the point was because you
[31:52] don't have to worry about film stock
[31:54] developing it the cost just got sucked
[31:57] out of this you could record forever
[31:58] even a bad actor could just keep take
[32:00] doing different takes you would get
[32:01] there and it didn't actually change the
[32:02] world I mean it did create YouTube it
[32:04] did create a lot of other content so
[32:06] maybe a nuts extended but it didn't
[32:08] change film
[32:09] so what's different about that argument
[32:11] than your argument for
[32:13] um you know AI replacing everything well
[32:16] the iPhone one right I found one the
[32:19] Camera World it destroyed it I also went
[32:22] music so
[32:23] my my like base case is that Apple wins
[32:26] probably this too to a large degree one
[32:29] because
[32:31] the phones are powerful enough and the
[32:33] models are going to shrink small enough
[32:36] that they can fit on a phone and so even
[32:38] some of these image generation models
[32:40] they can fit now on the phone
[32:42] text gen and same thing on a long enough
[32:44] time frame they will fit on the phone
[32:47] and um I think that you know that's
[32:50] always crazy but then people just get
[32:52] used to it they're like oh yeah iPhone
[32:53] 20 will have whatever it is native well
[32:57] just like laptops now have Wi-Fi built
[32:59] in there was a time you had to add
[33:01] Bluetooth with a dongle or Wi-Fi with a
[33:03] dongle or a PCM
[33:05] CIA card whatever that was called you
[33:07] know you'd have different card slots on
[33:08] your laptop to put in different
[33:10] peripherals now it's all on a chip
[33:11] somewhere and you don't have to do
[33:13] anything for it exactly I have one more
[33:16] Point here so my kids my kids are eight
[33:18] and five
[33:19] and they just think computers can
[33:21] generate images
[33:23] just totally natural to them
[33:26] you know in in the um I think it's
[33:29] adults and people that have struggled to
[33:32] use computers they're adult lives it's
[33:34] like
[33:35] this is these are the people that have
[33:38] you know a challenge like accepting that
[33:40] AI is going to power computers to do
[33:43] these tasks for us but kids and
[33:46] kids are like yeah of course of course
[33:47] yeah of course it's going to yeah I mean
[33:49] it's just like well it's so obvious that
[33:52] a computer could do it to them that it's
[33:54] not even special or interesting you know
[33:57] if you're of the age where you remember
[33:58] the internet uh happening in Broadband
[34:01] um and there was a moment in time where
[34:03] I was on a college campus in the late
[34:05] 80s and I had seen higher speed internet
[34:07] speeds bitnat and arpanet and people
[34:10] only had dial-ups I was using dial up at
[34:12] home but I was like you know this this
[34:13] can get a lot faster there are faster
[34:15] systems than this and I had installed
[34:16] token ring and Banyan Vines and then
[34:18] eventually ethernet in local area
[34:20] networks were like you know this thing's
[34:22] going to be able to carry images and
[34:23] pictures and sound and eventually video
[34:25] and so it's kind of the same thing like
[34:28] you your limitation right now
[34:30] that you're like oh it can produce
[34:32] interesting copy that's Sometimes good
[34:34] sometimes bad
[34:35] okay images and once in a while a three
[34:38] second looped video I mean you're gonna
[34:40] be able to talk to this thing and just
[34:41] make your own Star Wars story and it'll
[34:43] be indistinguishable then
[34:45] I don't know the original series or
[34:46] whatever 10 years ago series
[34:48] without any polish on it I mean that
[34:50] basically is
[34:52] doesn't take much of a jump actually
[34:54] only takes a huge jump if you haven't
[34:56] watched rapid change
[34:58] right well I think in the next year
[35:00] you'll see it
[35:01] um probably just take over
[35:04] business in general
[35:06] so we know it can generate business
[35:08] ideas we know it can create websites
[35:10] from an idea
[35:12] we know it can figure out who the core
[35:14] Persona is for that service we know it
[35:17] can access the apis that would retrieve
[35:20] right who the target contacts are
[35:22] we know it can write
[35:24] personalized emails to them right
[35:28] so it's going to come up with an idea
[35:30] you make your SAS startup and then it
[35:32] starts selling it for you it's it's in
[35:34] the same one big sequence I promise yeah
[35:37] that's all it is so that's
[35:39] all that is here today it's just a
[35:42] matter of infrastructure and that's
[35:43] something we're working on right now
[35:45] so what I mean what you've described
[35:49] means your own business because it's
[35:51] commodified so are you saying that your
[35:54] own business is gonna or your or are you
[35:56] saying your business will be commodified
[35:57] every 24 months and you'll just have to
[35:59] extend it
[36:00] no I'd say like most businesses are not
[36:03] commoditized by that Loop you know most
[36:06] businesses have some kind of like real
[36:08] world thing happening let's say like JP
[36:11] Morgan right that's not you can't really
[36:13] replicate JP Morgan with that kind of
[36:16] system but there are a lot of one
[36:20] services that can be replicated like
[36:23] Specialists Consulting a lot of that
[36:25] stuff can be replicated a lot of
[36:27] software companies can be replicated
[36:29] yeah I mean you're talking about
[36:30] regulation I mean you could I mean
[36:32] somebody's going to put Ai and web three
[36:34] point web3 together in crypto and be
[36:36] like make me a crypto that does X Y and
[36:38] Z they're trying to I mean they're

[38:28] copy Ai and what it's doing today
[38:29] because you and I were talking at South
[38:31] by uh and I was like huh a lot of the
[38:33] stuff you showed me is now built into
[38:35] chat gpt4 what does that do for your
[38:37] business yeah so I'll give you that same
[38:38] question which is hey you know the stuff
[38:40] you were talking about two years ago to
[38:42] your credit
[38:43] I literally put everybody in my company
[38:45] I said everybody has homework this
[38:47] weekend we're a finance company we all
[38:49] work six seven days a week if you don't
[38:51] like it don't work at a finance company
[38:53] um and I said just spend an hour or two
[38:55] playing with uh chat gbt and
[38:58] um tell me on Monday how it helps you do
[39:01] your job faster better or I wanted to
[39:03] come back with
[39:04] uh the sales team started doing
[39:06] prospecting in it
[39:07] and other people started doing marketing
[39:10] plans in it and I haven't gone through
[39:12] everybody's responses but uh the my team
[39:15] on this podcast has been doing podcast
[39:17] notes with it and that works really well
[39:19] which we thought was a goof 60 days ago
[39:21] when chat GPT 3.5 came out I was like
[39:23] just ask you what the revenue of this
[39:24] you know Netflix was the last five years
[39:26] and it was wrong and then chatgpt4 comes
[39:28] out it's like okay it's right so it's
[39:30] starting to things that we even noticed
[39:32] three months ago four months ago were
[39:33] wrong so you could and then we asked it
[39:35] to take you know
[39:37] um we will take a zoom recording of a
[39:40] meeting with a Founder transcribe it and
[39:43] this past week we took the transcripts
[39:45] which now Zoom is doing and then we had
[39:47] chat cpt4 summarize it and summarize it
[39:49] in three different lengths so now in our
[39:51] notion instance not only do we have the
[39:53] video with the interview with the
[39:55] founder recorded we have the transcript
[39:57] and then I guess two or three versions
[39:59] of it so I could read the short version
[40:01] of it and I was like it's pretty
[40:03] accurate I mean I wouldn't rely on it to
[40:05] make an investment decision but
[40:06] certainly would be interesting to read
[40:09] before you meet with the founder what
[40:11] about gpt5
[40:13] you have to assume gpt5 will be
[40:17] extremely
[40:19] less error prone
[40:21] and you will just trust it just like GPS
[40:24] the first GPS remember people ran off
[40:25] the side of Roads be like turn left and
[40:27] somebody would wind up in a cornfield
[40:29] like it said turn left and it's like
[40:30] exactly dummy you still have to look
[40:32] just also like autopilot it's like oh
[40:35] it's gonna stop at this red light unless
[40:37] like there's a Christmas tree at the red
[40:38] light you know confusing it
[40:40] um but it feels like you can trust it I
[40:42] think trust is going to be the main
[40:43] issue is can I trust this by default yes
[40:46] can I trust it more than a human and I
[40:48] trust self-driving on a highway more
[40:51] than I trust a human
[40:53] today
[40:54] yes yeah and we're we went through the
[40:58] that Valley where
[41:00] the quality was lower than people can
[41:02] produce and that was like the gpt3
[41:04] valley
[41:05] and that's where a lot of people are
[41:08] saying oh well the content's terrible
[41:09] and like it's awful quality and it's
[41:11] just gonna pollute the internet that's a
[41:13] very short duration until you basically
[41:16] can replicate all the steps that a
[41:18] person would go through to write a high
[41:20] quality article just replicate that at
[41:22] scale and I think one of the one of the
[41:25] key um one of the key points that even
[41:30] chat gpt3 is not
[41:32] it's kind of missing right now is the
[41:34] scalability
[41:36] component so in order for you to get
[41:38] value out of it you have to manually
[41:39] query it you know so your marketing team
[41:42] has to say okay we're gonna go do this
[41:43] or your sales team is manually
[41:45] configuring it
[41:46] the the area of opportunity for you know
[41:49] in our kind of viewpoint of the future
[41:51] is really scaled fully automated
[41:56] um workflows so you give the AI
[41:59] uh you kind of tell it what you want to
[42:00] do or or over time just give it access
[42:03] to your systems and then it will go and
[42:05] configure itself and it will try to
[42:08] improve your business for you
[42:09] autonomously so you can't really get
[42:13] there from chat and so but part of the
[42:17] back end infrastructure is very similar
[42:20] because in the world of autonomous
[42:22] business process agents
[42:25] that is like an agent billing platform
[42:27] and so you do need to say Okay I want to
[42:30] do this here's here that here's the list
[42:32] of tools you have access to go do it
[42:35] now instead of reporting back to me
[42:37] report back to yourself and then figure
[42:39] out how you can improve from there right
[42:42] so what you want to do is is build these
[42:46] um you know extend the data flows that
[42:49] you have coming off of your current
[42:50] software stack
[42:52] so you have a newsletter right yep
[42:56] what do you do with the information uh
[43:00] the data that comes out of the
[43:01] newsletter
[43:02] performance
[43:04] nothing
[43:05] don't care right so is there value there
[43:08] sure
[43:10] right and it's and it usually comes down
[43:12] to you like the team just doesn't have
[43:14] enough time to do everything right it's
[43:16] an afterthought to think about and to
[43:19] coach yourself there's no person on
[43:20] there so you could say
[43:22] every time the newsletter comes out at
[43:23] the end of the week tell us which
[43:25] stories got the most clicks and then
[43:27] what are stories like those that we can
[43:29] do more of
[43:31] boom and that's a set every week and it
[43:33] just sends them an agent so it's like
[43:35] Google alerts or magic leap had this
[43:38] idea that you'd have agents out there
[43:39] doing things for you but if you take a
[43:41] Google alert which is on your last name
[43:43] or your company name this is a googler
[43:45] that can do more advanced things
[43:48] yeah exactly and and even the newsletter
[43:50] maybe you have
[43:52] like very high value contacts in your in
[43:55] your newsletter database sure yeah right
[43:57] and you're like hey I actually want to
[43:58] personalize theirs so I want to take
[44:01] this content and just literally
[44:02] personalize it down like one to one to
[44:05] them because I want every single message
[44:08] they get from us to be extremely high
[44:10] quality ah interesting right
[44:12] so those are systems that are going to
[44:15] be you're going to be able to build
[44:16] we're building out
[44:18] um we have pilot Enterprise partners
[44:20] that we're working with now that are
[44:22] deploying some of these workflows into
[44:24] their existing business processes
[44:25] fascinating the they're the thing that
[44:28] compounds is once we set up a workflow
[44:32] um let's call it like the newsletter use
[44:33] case
[44:35] most newsletters would need it and so
[44:38] that is the thing that we're gonna copy
[44:40] a template in your library like motion
[44:43] has templates or other platform as
[44:46] templates and yeah that gets super
[44:48] interesting in a creative we did uh just
[44:51] as an example
[44:52] here's a couple of you know when we do
[44:54] when the when our researchers are going
[44:57] to do a Google search like I'm doing a
[45:00] live show and they're like hey when did
[45:01] Netflix launch when did it pass 100
[45:03] million Subs when did Disney plus launch
[45:04] when it allows do 100 Subs it's now
[45:07] getting that right it wasn't getting
[45:09] that right previously but here's
[45:10] examples of chat gbt doing that
[45:13] um and it does seem like barred from
[45:14] Google which I've been playing with has
[45:16] more recent information
[45:18] so in your mind how far behind is bard
[45:22] do you think in reality
[45:25] um probably the the measure that matters
[45:27] is the user base for for the chat
[45:30] programs I think
[45:32] that would that would be the the
[45:34] Difference Maker there that ultimately
[45:37] will determine who wins so then Google
[45:38] does win because even if
[45:40] openai has tens of millions of users
[45:42] Google has billions across Chrome
[45:44] Android YouTube
[45:46] Etc so Google wins
[45:49] I wouldn't count anybody out I wouldn't
[45:52] count Google out I mean Google has they
[45:54] have all the data sets that matter yep
[45:57] so they should be able to go faster and
[45:59] have the users and they have the
[46:00] browsers they have to really
[46:02] get their Vision together about what
[46:05] they're building and for them
[46:08] you know their goal was to make
[46:11] um you know
[46:13] all human knowledge accessible and
[46:15] useful that was like their mission
[46:17] statement
[46:18] and search does that
[46:20] right it does that along one dimension
[46:22] which is
[46:23] you can search for something so it's
[46:25] like I'm gonna pull information out and
[46:27] they show you the list of links
[46:30] which is great however the the idea that
[46:34] it's making it useful I think they've
[46:35] they're failing to deliver on that
[46:37] function the output that you get back
[46:40] that and then also
[46:43] just think about how much value is not
[46:44] sitting on the internet that you don't
[46:46] know about that would create value for
[46:49] you
[46:50] right and until now we've never had a
[46:54] way like a technology that could take
[46:56] all of that information and directly
[46:58] apply it and make your thing more
[47:00] valuable whatever it is you've built and
[47:02] have been working on
[47:04] right so even for for you you know your
[47:07] the media company content company you're
[47:09] trying to read a lot of stuff and figure
[47:12] out what's important what's valuable and
[47:14] they're and I'm sure in the past it's
[47:17] called four weeks you see more launches
[47:19] than you can even keep up with oh it's
[47:21] crazy I mean the number of people
[47:23] launching verticalized AI like if I had
[47:26] a nickel for every company that's going
[47:28] to respond to sales emails or customer
[47:30] support emails in a better fashion I
[47:32] mean it's in the hundreds now yeah right
[47:34] and and the thing we ran into we were
[47:36] trying to build verticalized Solutions
[47:38] and we've we realized that it's
[47:42] it's just uh
[47:44] it's basically the same back-end
[47:46] infrastructure that you need to do any
[47:47] of them
[47:48] and so
[47:50] rather than a large let's say bank
[47:53] trying to evaluate 3 000 vertical wise
[47:55] solution providers
[47:57] they'll they'll end up opting just for a
[47:59] platform and you've seen this happen
[48:02] over and over again so segment was a CDP
[48:05] layer customer day layer that they
[48:07] didn't have to build snowflake was a
[48:09] huge like data you know Data Warehouse
[48:11] in the cloud they didn't have to build
[48:13] that service now
[48:15] one of their Originals right
[48:19] just scaled so hard and they were very
[48:21] use case agnostic and that's that's very
[48:24] appealing for large companies because
[48:26] they're always trying to reduce the
[48:27] number of of tools that they have at the
[48:29] company level yeah for sure so that's I
[48:32] mean Microsoft Office perfect example
[48:33] yeah bundling of stuff so show us your
[48:35] product and where you're at with it and
[48:37] what people are using the most and it
[48:40] and specifically how does it differ from
[48:41] Chad gpt4 because as I said my premise
[48:44] was or my question to you was was like
[48:46] is this thing eventually Collide or are
[48:48] you just in an arms race where they're
[48:50] building this sort of web-based
[48:53] service and then they need people like
[48:55] you to build stuff on top of it yeah it
[48:58] works both ways I think there's plenty
[49:00] of room in in this you know in these
[49:02] categories this is our chat products
[49:06] we've connected it to the internet
[49:09] let's ask it
[49:14] so this
[49:15] you know svb got sold today
[49:17] yep and so this would be
[49:20] you know real-time query that we can run
[49:23] it
[49:26] um you know most people were using like
[49:28] our these tools here
[49:31] a second
[49:35] so over time all the latency drops and
[49:38] the costs drop and so for the uh for
[49:42] this result you know you're getting
[49:45] the actual articles right
[49:49] and through the citations you're surfing
[49:51] that web so you have Google news or some
[49:53] news feeds that interior using chat t4s
[49:57] like hey go check the web we can do
[49:58] anything we could do any of it we want
[50:00] so you can hit like you can do it in
[50:02] real time you can do like a search API
[50:04] that you can add add to the back end you
[50:07] can use the being API
[50:09] um
[50:11] that stuff doesn't really matter too
[50:13] much like you do any anything you want
[50:15] and then you can bring all those results
[50:16] back in
[50:17] and for for this one you know it answer
[50:21] the question really fast yeah right and
[50:24] when gbt3 launched it would make
[50:26] something up it would just literally
[50:28] make up like the wrong answer and be
[50:31] very confident in it yeah right what's
[50:34] the word for that is that what they mean
[50:35] when they say it's delusional or
[50:36] hallucination hallucination yeah it
[50:39] thinks it's right it has no idea yeah
[50:41] okay so this is impressive what next
[50:43] so what's happening in the back end is
[50:46] actually where the secret sauce gets
[50:49] built so when you and you know when a
[50:52] user comes in a chat and they ask a
[50:55] question
[50:57] the you know in the Google world it
[50:59] would just hit up its index so the index
[51:02] would say okay what's the closest set of
[51:04] results that I should show to this user
[51:07] based on that query
[51:09] in the generative world
[51:12] you can build these agents so you can go
[51:14] try to solve the problem
[51:16] and the more tools you give that agent
[51:18] the AI agent
[51:20] the better it can solve the problem so
[51:23] it is choosing now what route to take so
[51:27] these are not pre-programmed steps that
[51:29] you build into it
[51:30] so so it's saying I could go to
[51:32] Wikipedia I could go to Google news or
[51:35] Bing news or I could search the open web
[51:37] I could do a web crawl I could do excuse
[51:40] me any number of things I search Twitter
[51:41] search Reddit or quora
[51:44] and it somehow figures out you know what
[51:47] this news
[51:49] service is better or is it blending the
[51:52] new service with the web search
[51:55] it's going to do a little bit it can do
[51:56] whatever it wants yeah so this is a
[52:00] fundamentally a new way of building
[52:01] back-ends to Software
[52:04] the other thing that you know ours can
[52:06] do is it can recommend new steps so it
[52:10] can add you know we can figure out what
[52:12] tools it wants
[52:13] and we can give it access to more tools
[52:16] so in some cases people wanted access to
[52:19] like LinkedIn data
[52:20] right so we can go get a link an API
[52:23] that queries LinkedIn profiles and
[52:25] returns that and it's like a Json format
[52:27] which is like a data format and then now
[52:30] we can take that information and do
[52:31] something with it that's relevant to
[52:33] that user
[52:35] this is going to make these large data
[52:37] sets
[52:38] um invaluable and if you're going to use
[52:40] them you're going to need to get a
[52:41] licensing fee from LinkedIn Reddit quora
[52:44] maybe you could talk about
[52:45] what's going on in the back Channel
[52:47] because you're probably facing this
[52:48] yourself with those discussions I
[52:51] understand there's like multiple
[52:52] lawsuits about to drop on open AI for
[52:54] using various platforms data without
[52:56] explicit permission
[52:58] and once you start charging for stuff
[53:00] and you take 10 billion from Microsoft
[53:02] you can no longer be like oh it's an
[53:04] academic non-profit even non-profits
[53:06] like I don't know if you saw the Wayback
[53:08] machine the internet archive lost its
[53:10] copyright case that's a non-profit
[53:13] so this is clearly unfair use
[53:15] um no I don't know if it breaks the fair
[53:17] use will have like there'll be a big
[53:19] debate coming up but what's the back
[53:20] Channel right now about who gets access
[53:22] to quora Reddit Twitter
[53:25] pick a data set
[53:26] um and how will that hash out in your
[53:29] mind what's the Fair Route there
[53:32] that's a good question I think over time
[53:34] you know
[53:35] the like I mean licensing tends to get
[53:37] figured out over time yes music industry
[53:39] they figured it out even in the image
[53:41] generation side now I was at South by
[53:44] Southwest and at the Shutterstock booth
[53:46] and they had an AI generated image
[53:49] product
[53:49] and even them even though you're using
[53:52] AI to generate it they would find the
[53:54] images that went into the generation and
[53:57] they will pay a royalty to the copyright
[53:59] holder of that of those images yeah
[54:02] getting images suing stable diffusion
[54:04] right now uh yeah a bunch of Open Source
[54:07] developers are showing Microsoft's
[54:08] GitHub co-pilot so these those are the
[54:13] to me those were like very
[54:16] they should get sued at least
[54:21] um
[54:21] the the code base I think I would at
[54:25] least want to see like
[54:27] how those arguments play out so if you
[54:30] open source your code someone grabs it
[54:33] trains a model and it can is replicating
[54:35] your code verbatim and even in some
[54:37] cases like
[54:38] the you know the script the
[54:40] documentation script that was
[54:42] personalized to you I mean that's very
[54:44] traceable right yeah and that's the
[54:46] reason not to put citations in it why
[54:47] wouldn't you right so that that same
[54:50] thing happened on the initial stable
[54:52] diffusion data set so they did you know
[54:54] they grabbed images and you could see
[54:56] like Getty in the watermark The
[54:58] Watermark so we we kind of avoided doing
[55:02] image gen a lot of other platforms
[55:04] wanted to launch that as products but if
[55:07] uh you know any of these image
[55:09] generators they'll produce copyright and
[55:11] content and the way the copyright laws
[55:13] work is if you are the one that
[55:16] generated it on your servers and you're
[55:19] selling it like that's a you're gonna
[55:22] get deemed for that yeah and that's it's
[55:25] a derivative product that you created
[55:27] now if I were to load
[55:30] uh just like on my browser I can take my
[55:32] browser I can save a web page on my
[55:34] desktop but that's fair use
[55:36] um and I can even edit the web page on
[55:38] my desktop it's when I choose to put it
[55:39] out in Commerce that your copyright gets
[55:42] uh you know has problems but if I were
[55:45] to
[55:46] if I were to download the original chat
[55:48] TPT open source and it's no longer open
[55:51] source it's just like chat gpt4 is not
[55:53] open source now when did it stop being
[55:54] open source gpt3 is not open source so
[55:58] three and a half which powered chat not
[56:01] open source for not open source and it's
[56:04] unlikely that open AI will open source
[56:06] is there what's the number one competing
[56:09] product and how far behind were they
[56:11] because it would it seems the world
[56:12] needs an open source version of this and
[56:15] if I would have run the open source
[56:17] version on my cluster of servers or you
[56:19] know my desktop my phone and pointed out
[56:23] a data set that I had access to well
[56:25] that's for my own personal use uh nobody
[56:28] can stop me right you can do that and
[56:30] even the stable diffusion models they've
[56:31] they've shrunk them down they can fit on
[56:33] your my MacBook or your phone so no you
[56:37] know no kind of copyright issue there
[56:39] but if you try to monetize that you do
[56:41] run into it in terms of Open Source
[56:44] um open AI is still say the art
[56:47] um for their for their core foundational
[56:49] models
[56:50] um they the advantage actually is not on
[56:54] the training side it's it's the
[56:55] computational intensity side so it's how
[56:58] they optimize their Hardware how they
[56:59] optimize the training of the models
[57:02] that's where you build a really
[57:04] compounding competitive Advantage
[57:06] because the bottleneck across the world
[57:09] right now is GPU capacity capacity and
[57:11] availability so Nvidia has back orders
[57:15] like crazy for their h100 GPU
[57:21] it's a really expensive GPU so like a
[57:24] graphical you know processing unit
[57:28] and it was you know it's what powers
[57:29] video games it does a lot of
[57:32] um kind of Matrix math and that's what
[57:36] you know these neural Nets really need
[57:38] that at at scale and
[57:41] anytime a big company wants to launch an
[57:43] AI powered product that's just more
[57:45] compute that's needed to serve that up
[57:48] and um I think most people have run into
[57:50] like outages Chad GPT goes down or open
[57:53] AI goes down
[57:55] um it's a function of like the
[57:56] limitations of you know just not having
[57:59] enough of these gpus uh in their server
[58:02] Farm and getting overlooked but isn't
[58:04] the tensor stuff all Open Source
[58:06] Hardware as well so other people should
[58:07] be able to build these and compete over
[58:09] time
[58:10] no
[58:12] um
[58:13] Nvidia has you know they make
[58:16] Custom Modified chips for for folks and
[58:19] they competed pretty hard
[58:21] Google did have the the tpus the tensor
[58:24] processing units but those have not
[58:25] really performed for for the
[58:27] applications in the the same way for
[58:30] other companies this is not my area of
[58:32] expertise no I I mean I'm hearing people
[58:35] talk about the shortage now and it does
[58:36] seem like it's an opportunity for you
[58:39] know massive competition again open
[58:40] source and another technology you know
[58:43] that Hardware is made and you know
[58:46] like tsmc Taiwan it's my conductor and
[58:49] that's a whole geopolitical risk too and
[58:53] um it's pretty amazing
[58:55] that we've been talking about this
[58:56] invasion of Taiwan now for
[58:59] you know close to a decade but that has
[59:01] gotten more and more heated the last
[59:02] couple years and that
[59:06] um increased tension seems to parallel
[59:09] the development of AI
[59:11] and uh covid
[59:15] yeah I don't know that's that is like
[59:17] you know Taiwan built itself on the back
[59:20] of its semiconductor industry because
[59:22] that was the thing that would get the
[59:24] most protection from the US yeah over
[59:27] time and that was a good bet that was a
[59:29] good call on that but I think even tsmc
[59:32] is saying hey maybe we need to diversify
[59:33] a little bit and start opening up Fabs
[59:36] in the US oh and they are yeah India
[59:38] everywhere yep
[59:40] it's absolutely fantastic so show me
[59:42] your product before we wrap up here in
[59:43] run out of time uh any other pieces you
[59:46] want to show any other like things
[59:47] you're super proud of I mean it's super
[59:49] impressive
[59:50] um and I understand now the difference
[59:51] uh yours is doing a lot more inputs in
[59:54] the way it's kind of like zapier or if
[59:56] this than that kind of is built into it
[59:59] natively so it can go find more sources
[60:02] dynamically yeah it can go do that and
[60:05] then I think you know over time
[60:07] and this is what I was getting to about
[60:09] software in general you know
[60:12] you could you've bought software for
[60:14] your team before right sure and then
[60:17] what happens if the team doesn't use the
[60:19] software to its fullest potential
[60:23] we unsubscribe at some point hopefully
[60:25] somebody remembers they put it on a
[60:26] credit card but I cancel our cards every
[60:28] year where I have the cards that you can
[60:29] set the limit on where like I just say
[60:31] okay take all the cards down to zero and
[60:33] let's watch our phones ring off the hook
[60:35] as SAS vendors are like hey your card's
[60:37] not working
[60:39] that that definitely works and one of
[60:42] the the big the big shift here is when
[60:45] you move away from software and towards
[60:47] agents the agents know how to use these
[60:49] tools better than people do and so
[60:52] they're going to extract all the value
[60:53] out of these tools and that it could be
[60:55] apis that could be really anything and
[60:58] you're seeing it across the board in all
[61:00] these little pointed Solutions but
[61:02] imagine wrapping all those Point
[61:03] Solutions into a generalized platform
[61:05] that's that's what we're building
[61:08] makes sense yeah this is uh pretty crazy
[61:12] well listen you had a team of 30 or 40
[61:14] over there
[61:15] 35.
[61:17] yeah I mean uh you raised some a decent
[61:21] amount of cash and you got a decent
[61:22] amount of Revenue coming in are you
[61:24] finding your clients are this is you're
[61:28] you're too far ahead of what they need
[61:30] or they're just trying to get understand
[61:31] this or now with chat gbt354 they're all
[61:35] like oh my God we have to catch up I
[61:37] know we paid for this we need to now
[61:38] expand it and we need to understand this
[61:41] because our bosses are breathing down
[61:42] our
[61:43] uh throats it it's a mix so yeah there
[61:46] there's an AI maturity model Gartner
[61:48] published this model in 2019 and they
[61:51] said hey look we're going to start by
[61:52] companies kind of being interested in
[61:54] different you know potential with AI
[61:57] yeah the I've taken that and adapted
[62:00] their maturity model and basically that
[62:02] phase one is like the end users are
[62:05] gonna start bringing in different AI
[62:07] tools into their day-to-day workflows
[62:09] so that would be like people using chat
[62:12] gbt using our chat yeah that's also
[62:14] powered by Chad GPT or
[62:17] um you know using copywriting tools I
[62:19] saw canva Adobe you know everybody's got
[62:23] a motion everybody's got an AI feature
[62:25] kind of a wizard yeah which which was
[62:28] you know
[62:29] I think it took two years and probably
[62:32] the 3.5 model was really the point where
[62:34] those companies would say okay we can we
[62:37] feel okay trusting this and putting this
[62:38] out there for our customers
[62:41] um so that's really phase one is are
[62:43] your is your team using it the second
[62:45] piece would be is your team able to
[62:47] actually scale its usage of AI and
[62:51] that's not something that chat GPT is
[62:53] going to really help your team do
[62:55] but if you wanted to make you know
[62:57] repeatable processes uh build you know
[63:00] build actual components of your business
[63:02] so focusing on the system rather than
[63:04] the manual tasks automation
[63:07] um so that's where you know we built
[63:09] into that that's kind of phase two and
[63:11] then phase three is when you connect you
[63:14] begin to connect enough of the workflows
[63:16] together so that the data feedback loop
[63:18] starts to really run like a flywheel and
[63:21] at that point now more and more of your
[63:23] business is going into odd like
[63:25] autonomous mode
[63:27] and as you exit as you go into
[63:30] autonomous mode people have to actually
[63:32] build that system out and it and it's
[63:36] not the AI team but it's actually the
[63:37] business users
[63:39] people The Business Leaders
[63:42] even the functional people a lot of
[63:44] people want want to actually build these
[63:46] systems out and so you are seeing kind
[63:49] of
[63:49] two groups emerge one they're excited
[63:52] about you know building more efficient
[63:54] systems being able to do more projects
[63:56] than their you know their team could
[63:58] have ever done before and they're the
[64:00] ones that are really AI native and
[64:01] that's who we build for and then you
[64:04] have folks that are really hesitant to
[64:06] adopt in any of the systems and tooling
[64:09] and ultimately those companies are not
[64:11] going to be competitive kind of in the
[64:14] 12 to 18 month time frame they're gonna
[64:16] become rapidly uncompetitive
[64:18] and then
[64:19] pretty much at every company the CEO is
[64:22] like hey
[64:23] AI is here like what's our AI plan
[64:25] what's our AI strategy right yeah and so
[64:28] then there's a really big gap between
[64:30] the end user tool and the CEO yeah right
[64:33] and so where we found success with our
[64:36] platform is selling the vision of the
[64:38] platform to the like CEO c-suite and
[64:42] then the leaders of all those groups
[64:43] because they say okay well can you can
[64:45] you do this use case can you do this use
[64:46] case can you it's like yes yes yes
[64:48] because it's all basically just stacking
[64:50] these blocks together
[64:52] and um
[64:54] that'll cover that I mean that could be
[64:56] a 10-year time frame where that really
[64:59] gets adopted or it could be like three
[65:01] years five years it really depends on
[65:04] um the level one of interest and then
[65:06] two it's like how fast is the underlying
[65:08] technology really going to improve
[65:11] um right now the bottleneck is people
[65:13] don't even know what's possible with AI
[65:16] yet so there is a key and that's why I
[65:18] just told everybody start playing with
[65:20] it and it's kind of like mobile you know
[65:22] one of the first steps people did in
[65:24] Mobile was or even Cloud was just give
[65:27] everybody a mobile phone so everybody
[65:28] had flip phones and they're like just
[65:30] get everybody on your team on mobile
[65:31] phone get everybody your team an iPad if
[65:33] you want to build iPad apps they got at
[65:35] least have iPad if you want to see what
[65:36] 5G and broadband's like just buy all
[65:39] your Executives Broadband at home and
[65:41] get them laptops and show them how it
[65:42] works right they need to really start
[65:44] soaking it and playing with it and and
[65:46] then the use cases will come out and
[65:48] it's like anything else some people will
[65:49] go too slow
[65:50] like Microsoft did with mobile
[65:52] and they'll give more videos
[65:55] they didn't miss this one I mean this is
[65:57] like the makeup for missing mobile right
[65:58] you think about having a family they
[66:00] miss mobile and now how well
[66:03] they hit this one they're like we're not
[66:05] going to miss this one we'll pay 10
[66:06] billion and then you look at like Mark
[66:07] Zuckerberg with ar VR or maybe to a
[66:10] lesser stunt Apple who has advice coming
[66:12] maybe they just also made huge bets and
[66:16] those huge bets are just not going to
[66:17] hit the mark so yeah it's uh one of the
[66:20] great things about technology is how
[66:21] Dynamic it is all right listen Paul
[66:22] you're in a you're amazing uh really
[66:24] great overview for people who don't know
[66:26] about it and if you're in the business
[66:28] of running a business
[66:30] I think that's as plainly as you can say
[66:32] copy AI might be able to help you be
[66:34] more efficient so go check it out we
[66:35] have free plants there's a free plan
[66:37] goes to go play with it and until your
[66:39] free plan uh you use up all your credits
[66:42] and then uh you go or what do you do
[66:43] multiplayer mode is where you have to
[66:45] pay
[66:45] we're doing uh right now it's still
[66:47] credits because it yeah yeah it's a
[66:49] little pricey for us oh it is pricey
[66:51] yeah yeah
[66:54] I mean I thought open AI dropped the
[66:57] price like 100 or 90 or something they
[66:59] did they that saved that saved us pretty
[67:02] good yeah that was it was going to be
[67:05] quite expensive and they'll do that
[67:06] again I guess I bet right yeah
[67:08] over time it's going to go to zero and
[67:11] so then you'll have the scale the
[67:13] volumes will really start to to work
[67:15] through the system and that's another
[67:17] reason that I wouldn't want to focus on
[67:19] the end user
[67:21] Point Solutions because you won't have
[67:24] enough volume over time to really Propel
[67:26] a business
[67:28] yeah
[67:30] it's incredible to think about you know
[67:32] something about because there is so it's
[67:34] so easy to create companies
[67:36] and you're seeing this AI hype race
[67:38] right but then
[67:41] the durability of a lot of the point
[67:43] Solutions is really going to be
[67:44] questionable I think well I also think
[67:46] you have to also want and have the
[67:48] motivation and when human motivation
[67:50] this is a very hard reality for most
[67:54] people especially woke people or people
[67:56] who want to believe the world is fair in
[67:58] some way like it really does break their
[68:00] brain when you're like okay now solve
[68:03] for motivation because I can take any
[68:04] course from MIT or Harvard or Stanford
[68:07] online for free right now and so the
[68:11] world's unfair and those Ivy League
[68:13] schools have now given all their
[68:15] information out for free
[68:16] or the vx100 you can buy a used one and
[68:19] make a movie and so Hollywood's holding
[68:20] you back or you could get three or four
[68:22] of your friends together and make a
[68:23] movie this weekend or a short film for
[68:24] free what's holding you back and that's
[68:26] what I learned over time is that human
[68:29] creativity is all there but motivation
[68:31] that fire in your belly the desire to go
[68:34] do something sometimes the unhealthy
[68:36] Obsession and desire to go do something
[68:38] that's one that we still as much
[68:43] abundance as we have can't seem to solve
[68:46] for we can't make people motivated to go
[68:48] change the world some people are and
[68:49] some people aren't my my oldest daughter
[68:52] I asked her like what do you want to do
[68:53] you know when you grow up and she's like
[68:55] well I want to want to breed dogs and I
[68:57] want to do art
[68:58] I'm like sweet I said you can do that
[69:00] now like you don't need to go to college
[69:02] yeah
[69:03] dog breeder or make art and that sounds
[69:06] like a pretty girl she said she said
[69:07] I'll breed dogs and then I'll sell the
[69:09] dogs and I use the money to buy more art
[69:11] supplies
[69:14] yeah and buy more dogs right so I think
[69:17] if if I could have one wish it would be
[69:19] that when we do go update the
[69:21] curriculums of schools yeah that the
[69:24] only thing that we instill is like that
[69:26] creativity and getting things done that
[69:27] you care about and if you drive that
[69:29] passion forward
[69:31] everyone will be successful because
[69:33] you'll have unlimited tools to make
[69:34] things happen there's literally in a
[69:36] school of um
[69:38] Academia so there's Montessori and then
[69:40] there's something called Reggio and
[69:41] Reggio the one of the Core Concepts is
[69:44] uh Regio Emilia is
[69:47] figure out what the child is motivated
[69:49] by and then have the curriculum taught
[69:52] through that in your case art supplies
[69:55] and art and puppies uh and and dog
[69:58] breeding so you could teach biology
[70:00] obviously through dog breeding and you
[70:02] can teach math and you teach science
[70:04] through the science of oil painting or
[70:06] sculpture and you know the physics of it
[70:09] you can teach anything through a lens in
[70:11] which somebody's you know if somebody's
[70:12] into skiing you could teach them physics
[70:14] of skiing and they would learn all the
[70:16] physics Concepts but they would be super
[70:18] motivated and then teaching physics
[70:20] abstractly they're not motivated turns
[70:22] out every kid could learn physics or
[70:24] pick a topic if you just put it in the
[70:26] right wrapper
[70:28] um but yeah the education system is
[70:29] broken I just we should just ask copy AI
[70:31] right now how to fix the education
[70:32] system I'm sure it has a great answer
[70:35] well you can do custom you know custom
[70:37] learning plans for people people already
[70:39] building those those systems out and
[70:40] even like linking to the right YouTube
[70:43] video to watch
[70:45] that's awesome yeah if announce that
[70:47] it's incredible yeah
[70:50] at some point it'll be like hey where
[70:52] what is this person stuck on
[70:56] you
[70:59] know like some kids lost in life they're
[71:02] like oh this kid's lost like okay let's
[71:03] figure out some assessment tool and then
[71:05] it's like okay here's what would
[71:07] motivate this kid uh watch these five
[71:09] videos and it's like watch this
[71:11] Gladiator video watch this like skiing
[71:13] video watch this puppy video and then
[71:16] listen to this song in a second it's
[71:18] gonna unlock their brain and unstuck
[71:19] them that'd be awesome that'd be pretty
[71:21] pretty great all right listen we'll see
[71:22] everybody next time on this week in
[71:24] startups bye bye everybody

## Full Text (No Timestamps)

hey everybody hey everybody we all know the AI space is moving at a blistering Pace right now so we decided to do a little ad hoc mini series on it we're calling it innovators in AI very creative every week I'm going to interview a Founder in the AI space here on this weekend startups and every founder that joins is going to be building something awesome that is the criteria we don't want just pontification we want to actually see real products and today we have the CEO of copy AI Paul yacubian we have a great conversation about the insane pace of AI as I mentioned and building products for a specific niche in this case writing copy AI right they do writing on top of various llms and he explains how he's dealing with the fact that hey he started I think with GPT two or three then they went 3.545 is coming out Bard is coming out from Google so many different llms out there how do you actually build a product that people are willing to to pay for when these core platforms are moving so fast that they're going to absorb the Innovations of people building on top of them almost in real time this is a major issue for Founders who are building in GPT or in AI with open ai's products so it's going to be a great and insightful episode please stick with us this week in startups is brought to you by Mercury where Innovation meets peace of mind now more than ever startups need a safe

and Mayfair helps venture-backed companies protect and grow their cash automatically diversify where you hold your cash increase your FDIC insurance coverage and earn up to 4.35 percent yield on deposits go to getmayfair.com twist to get started today all right everybody next up on the program is a company that's been doing generative AI specifically in copy and words for a couple of years I met Paul a couple years ago when he was raising money for copy dot AI my bestie David sacks from craftventures is an investor in the company and I remember meeting you Paul and Paul's last name is Jacobian or you could be in rent that's right that's right here you go yeah um you I remember were working on a couple of experiments when we met one of them was like doing tag lines for users I don't know if you were using chat GPT at that point but when did you first become aware of chat GPT and or generative AI for copy good question so I started using gpt2 in the end of 2019 and we were using it to create startup ideas so we were it was insanely creative but it was really bad at telling the truth because it wasn't trained on as much data as gpt3 was and it was immediately clear that the creative power was where the value driver would come from with the generative AI models and I thought it'd be seven years away from being commercially viable because it would just make stuff up and you had to really help like constrain the outputs of it to drive value from it um so I was creating science fictional products and just like had this explosion of ideas what was the interface like for that Chet gpt2 at the time was it all like a Dev tool because I remember it was a lot of startups were trying to get access to it yeah wasn't really available it was actually open source so you somebody had to set up the model host it and then build the UI for it and the the simplest UI was really just a text box where you would type something in and then just click a button and it would auto complete it for you and so I was using that but I wanted a lot of ideas and so I kept hitting the button and then deleting what it printed out and then hit it again and I was like a search interface would make way more sense like a ux interface for brainstorming and so I thought it would be about seven years before the model would actually be good enough because only about 10 of the results even made sense at that time with gpd2 and then fast forward until uh July of 2020 which is only like six months later and they launched EBT through which is 100 times the size of gpt2 and that all the numbers flipped so all of a sudden most of the time it was making sense what was coming out ah and so when you we're doing 2.0 it was really interesting to look at the history of it I'm sure people are going to study this rapid Pace that this has gone on you there was no web-based service there's no cloud-based service you had to download it and then did you have to provide a model or was there already some training in it based on some model yeah they had pre-trained it and they had open sourced the model so somebody else ended up hosting it and providing that interface got it and so that's what I was using it were they upfront about what was in the model or did they just say hey we trained it on some stuff um or were they explicit hey we downloaded the Wikipedia hey we did quora hey we did Reddit with a at that time because that's something that I've been trying to get my head around and hopefully you can educate Us in the audiences to what what exactly how do you know what's been it's been trained on yeah they they I think in the paper listed out a number of the sources one is a common crawl data set it's just a huge huge file that's open source you can download it and you can use that to train the model Wikipedia was a big a big component crawl that's in a common crawl of open web so a bunch of web pages that are in an open source search engine of sorts that's right they got Reddit and I don't think they got quora at that time I think yeah probably had a paywall or something or a registration wall so they couldn't get in there right I think since then they have they have probably gotten access somehow to courts data set so you see 3.0 and it goes from one in ten times to getting it right to one in ten times getting it wrong yes another way nine and ten times dude at least making sense like it wasn't completely gobbling up gibberish exactly yeah so the first the first thing that came to my mind was like this is the next big wave and Tech because all that you have all these new use cases that are unlocked and we would I thought we would see you know immediately I've tweeted this out I thought it was a phase change of the internet so this is the first time the internet me trained and synthesized into a model and then talk back to you directly right so that's a profound change in the amount of information that you have access to at any any moment in time and given that you're kind of able to talk to the internet I thought the conversational interfaces would be the most relevant way to access that information that's in inside the models so we built built a slack bot and we asked uh openai if we could launch it and their safety team said no you can't launch that it's too dangerous and so we had to go back to the drawing board and we built um built the an app that could just summarize whatever you threw at it so we launched that we got a mention and the uh Wall Street Journal um for that and then we realized you know people that's like a sometimes use case I mean that is a component of of a skill that the AI models have but that's not something that people will subscribe for and pay us money every month listen as a Founder ensuring your cash is safe is priority number one it's been a bit crazy out there I don't want to put caps locks on right now but I will if you need me to the FDIC 250 000 limit is just not enough for most businesses so let me tell you about Mercury through its partner Banks and sweep Network Mercury customers can access up to five Milli five million in FDIC Insurance that's 20 times the per Bank limit sounds a lot safer doesn't it well these sweep networks protect your deposits by spreading them across multiple Banks which limits the risk of any single point of failure and with Mercury Vault any funds above the FDIC limit can easily be invested in a money market fund mostly comprised of U.S government-backed security so it's easy to get started with opening an account you can apply at minutes and many customers are approved and onboarded in less than two hours Mercury also offers great resources for Founders including my favorite raise this program connects founders with investors to help them raise funds head to mercury.com to join more than a hundred thousand startups that trust Mercury for Banking and if you're interested in Mercury Rays applications for both seed and series a are open through April 20 right so you got to get it in there by April 20th Mercury is a financial technology company not a bank banking services are provided by Choice Financial Group and evolve Bank and Trust members FDIC when it's summarizing something explain to a lay person what it's actually doing so you have a paragraph let's say you have uh I don't know a movie review from The New York Times it's a thousand words about some you know really detailed movie like tar right Academy Award uh uh oscar-nominated best picture what what does it do what is the what is the um what is the model actually doing when it is summarizing so there there are different techniques for summarization for these models um you know based on neural networks the neural net is learning skills so it is it has learned skills that you'd have otherwise needed specialty natural language processing algorithms to do and that's really what sets it apart so when you had 176 billion parameters in the model and they're structured into layers these layers get really good at doing certain things and for the summarization tasks it can learn you know what summarization means like what does the word mean to summarize something you can pick that up from the Corpus that it's trained on so that all the text that it's trained on and then that is a task it can do it can do pretty well which which to me I was like okay now this one model we can use to do all of these natural language processing tasks without needing a bunch of NLP Engineers on the team it's literally one API call and I can just prompt it in natural language and tell it what I want and it'll give that back to me so the the first thousand major unlock because it suddenly made the process of building an MVP a software MVP that uses natural language technology um made that really easy so you could build a prototype and launch it and so when we built our next uh prototype it was called taglines.a it was just a tagline generator that took 48 hours from beginning to end to build the entire thing and we launched it 48 hours after saying okay maybe people would buy you know maybe marketers would buy words if we can generate them and So within the first week we had validated that not only would you have professional copywriters using these tools but you'd have marketers and Freelancers and small business owners students it's like that was a huge validation of the market size and the tan potential because it was such a wide user base and then we also validated that people would use a tagline generator to do like email subject lines headers for websites um just all kind of like PowerPoint slide you know titles um and really validated that the number of use cases were really wide for that as well and then threw up like a stripe paywall and then validated people would sign up for a subscription so we started charging three dollars a month we got some subscribers raise it to six and then raise it to ten and we continue to get subscribers coming in so at that point we validated one that it was commercially viable that you had a wide market and a wide set of use cases right and that makes sense there are copy editors in the world you discovered this is working nine out of ten times and if you could make that more efficient for ten dollars a month if they the average copywriter I think freelance probably gets paid 50 bucks an hour 40 bucks an hour 60 bucks an hour so in that range I mean it's not even one hour of their time so that's always one of those great tools for Founders is to say what does this person get paid an hour okay this attorney gets paid a thousand dollars an hour save them one hour a month they'll pay you a thousand dollars or they'll be okay with it right exactly so when we went through that exercise it was really clear that from all the way from a student to professional would find Value in these AI models and then the thing that we learned from going from two to three was that if you throw more data at it it's going to get even better and better at performing these tasks at an expert level or Beyond so now when we get to gpt4 to get back to this sort of these jumps it was three I think there was three point five and four in terms of major releases you're working directly with the open AI team you have some Insider access to it I understand so you were kind of in touch with them and and seeing what was coming what was coming between three and three point five and three point five and four yeah so for 3.5 they ended up tuning it to human feedback and so what what that would do is it would allow you to to kind of describe the intent that you had and you wouldn't have to prompt it with examples as much so when we first built our tools each tool you had to give an examples of what good looks like and you had to make sure that even the examples are very diverse when they ended up fine-tuning it on human feedback they kind of programmed that in across a wide variety of use cases and so that enabled the chat GPT experience where you can just tell it what you want and it'll figure out and actually create that content that you want uh and so when you saw three 3.54 maybe you could describe for the audience yeah the the step functions there you said before hey you know it's right one out of ten times then it's right nine out of ten times now let's go to 3.5 and 4. 3.5 yeah it was awesome it was like a big a big leap and a lot of the complexity and prompting it kind of went away a lot of um even the use cases for more fine-tuning of models so um you'll see a lot of startups talk about how valuable they're they're fine-tuned models are like oh we have proprietary models well at the end of the day not there aren't that many models that are really relevant for for you to have fine to explain what the model is again to a layperson and what's an incredible example of that where you're restricting it and building a model that maybe results in better output yeah so the these are foundational models so these are built to be general purpose that means they can do a lot of things at you know are pretty pretty solid rate what they figured out was that the general purpose model could actually outperform specialized models if they kind of made them bigger um and train it on more data and that is nuts that's nuts so I don't know if you've seen some of the gpt4 metrics but they've they said oh well it passed the bar exam it passed like these all these examples right it's getting better across every single category so that's measurement pause on that for a second yeah you used to build in the industry what was called narrow AI yes narrow learning so hey we're going to learn how to beat um you know humans at poker chess go you know pick a video game fortnite and we'll really just work in that narrow subject area now this more General model um a little confusing to use the word General because it's loaded because there's General AI as a concept which is thinking like a human but they are average or their default model maybe is a better word for their default model is better at doing the lstat or the SATs or the bar exam then a model that was trained just to do the bar exam that's what we're they're learning with four that's right and you seem to say hey that's insane why is that insane why is that insane uh it really does level the playing field if you have access to those the gpt4 model so you don't need a whole team of AI Engineers who don't need a whole team of machine learning Engineers you can actually build you can just go straight into building the application I was going to say something that I think larger companies are running into issues around is they've kind of delegated the like hey AI team go figure out this generative AI stuff but the AI team you know the AI team comes back and says you know what we can't beat GPT three and a half we can't beat gpt4 they'll get fired right right that's fascinating so if I was working inside of I don't know Amazon would you say Walmart and I said hey our internal teams is a great example Amazon's a great example yeah I'm in Amazon I want to optimize Amazon Prime members to show them better reviews and show them better q a so take the Q a section on an Amazon page in the review section and we'll summarize it and make it better for users if GPT 4 can do that better than the internal team well why is there even an internal team yeah that's pretty wild depends on the use case so if you looked at like the iPhone voicemail system you know try to transcribe a voicemail message they had I don't have any thousand AI engineers at Apple and then openai had a team of I think two or three people then figured out how to how to complete the um Voice to Text task and they ended up launching a model called whisper and they open sourced it they literally gave away the technology and it dramatically outperformed all of the existing Technologies all of it all right everybody our friends from Microsoft are here Tom Davis a senior director at Microsoft for startups and you're a former founder you are here today to talk to us about the giant leaps that Microsoft has made in the AI space what does this mean for startups I see a ton of different tools I've been playing with chat TPT for I have a paid account but I'm also seeing things happen with GitHub absolutely so uh the work that we've been doing with open AI over the last few years has really set ourselves up with a foundation around uh we've built this sort of AI super computer from the ground up and we've been looked at everything from GPU configurations to networking and things and really what we're now able to do is sort of allow startups to access all of this Innovation through our Founders Hub so we've been building this just do something at scale so startups can now build their own AI applications and and build out and train llms as well and this has really helped us to become a far better Cloud for AI broadly and being able to drive that down to the startup ecosystem is fantastic it's open to everybody there's no funding requirement you don't have to be anointed by a VC five minutes to sign up you get six figures of benefits Azure credits GitHub open AI apis which everybody's really having fun playing with and so much more so go ahead and sign up right now AKA dot Ms slash this week in startups AKA dot MS slash this week in startups thanks so much Tom thank you so as we're looking at this yeah this is almost like the snake is eating its own towel kind of situation we're all going you know uh copywriters your name of your company's copy AI you got 12 million dollars in reoccurring revenue and your premise which turned out to be absolutely correct is hey this thing is advancing fast copywriters are going to use this tool to be willing to pay for it's going to make them bionic make them superhuman um we'll replace them but might replace the bottom third that are terrible at their jobs or make the bottom third great at their jobs or good at their jobs was that your central tenant um about this because the replacing of a job or elimination of the job in other words I'm the developer or I'm the CEO I'll just ask chatgpt for copy and I don't need a copy editor uh what what is your belief now let's take copy editing your wheelhouse is copy editing gonna go away and the CEO or the sales team just does the cop asked chappy T to do it or will there be bionic copywriters who use this as a starting point I think before you know before we launch copy I had no idea what copywriters even did so it was it was never about copywriting it was that was basically the first use case that I thought would be relatively translatable against the models but the thing that really motivates me and my co-founder is the idea that people have great like a high degree of creativity especially kids yeah they're super creative I've got two daughters that are extremely creative and then they we pre-train them through school right just like these models are now pre-trained on the internet and all that pre-training kind of stamps out the creativity and by the time they graduate they're very tracked in the things that they want to do yeah so it's like oh I'm going to be an attorney or I'm going to be an accountant or I'm going to be a software engineer and I think that that whole process is going to come to an end here because gpt4 can do all of the liberal arts better than any expert could right and now that's a tool that's in your pocket which means we don't need to train people on a lot of these very technical tasks that we used to because we've now trained computers to do that repeatedly so there will be a very uh you know a challenging transition for a lot of Industries a lot of Institutions like higher education education in general and we're gonna have to figure out okay what what's the best use of of a person's time well that that usually comes down to the individual and what we what I'm seeing you know the whole my whole hope here is that people can be way more creative because each time they are creative they have an outlet to actually build something they can actually get things done so a non-copyrighter a non-writer somebody's just not good at words can now go in there and be good at words so you take these exactly 80 of people who are not good at that now they can be good at it I may not be good at drawing or illustrating but I can pop up stable diffusion or any number of tools and I could be a good illustrator so now you've got the 99 of people who have no illustration skill can't draw for not uh and they can be creative so it's not that that everybody's job goes away it's that everybody gets good at everybody's job yes that's an interesting way to look at it right and that's that's incredibly powerful especially if when you're looking at entrepreneurship so there if you've ever tried to create your own website for example that takes a lot of time and it can be very stressful for somebody that's trying to get something off the ground that is now you know going to be pretty much instantaneous like oh I need a website boom I've got one yeah I need I need a presentation boom you know I can just generate a whole like my old deck um yeah and so which happens now you can go on Squarespace pick a template and now you'd be able to a future version of Squarespace will be hey make me a website and show me five different designs I need one that's funkier I need one that's a little more avant-garde um the challenge is what kind of business are you going to create that's gonna actually be able to compete against what the AI models can do yeah well and to your point the AI developers who are making this are literally working themselves out of a job the better they do the less they're needed because the general model can do better than the specific model so at least in that case the narrow specific models are being subsumed into the general models yes yeah you're seeing that and then you're also seeing it um in the software itself so I'll give you kind of a run through here so yeah software is why is software valuable Jason uh because it makes people more efficient which means it reduces the cost of any good or service right and and what like why software is valuable is because it's reusable so your investment to build a big part of it yeah right it's a reusability so we're now heading in a into a world where software can be generated on the Fly right and it's almost the cost of creating new software is going to zero hmm right that means that the Returns on investing in that software should also go to zero which causes some problems in the Venture Capital Community I'm an angel investor yeah yeah you're an angel investor um so we really this whole thing is going to get transformed from a technology standpoint fantastic I mean if you can build a company with two people instead of ten or ten people instead of 30 well that means you need less investment in the earliest investors are the only ones who get to seat at the table I'm fine with that I'm fine with people who do serious B and C is getting blocked from having an opportunity to invest because the company's too profitable is that sort of your premise it takes less money to run this just like cloud computing drop the cost of it yeah so when it should expand the number of people that can build things which should be good overall for entrepreneurship uh two like you said on the growth stages that's that's going to increasingly make I think a little bit less sense and you've seen you saw YC shut down the continuity fund and which is their growth stage fund uh this week and and so in that and then when we look at the AI landscape a lot of the repeatable tasks are in the sales and marketing space so like personalization now can be done on a one-to-one basis um at scale even things like querying databases you know that's something that people had to do on their own so you'd have to figure out well how do I write the right search query to get the right results maybe on LinkedIn um so what what you're going to see happen in this uh you know chat is a great example of this we'll Express intent right which is what our query is when we type into chat and then the AI will like figure out what it needs to go do to get us back what we're looking for and so that that is a world of AI agents where we're letting the AI go and do things for us and that world looks very different as well so AI doesn't need an interface to go grab data right it can just query apis directly and go get the information it needs if it's allowed to if it has access to it exactly so I had a tweet about this I said the biggest by the end of the year is my prediction the biggest search engine on the planet won't be Google it'll be Bing and it won't be because people are using it's because the Bots are using it so so many Bots are doing queries that it's just going to increase the size of the Corpus and the learning model the Corpus the Corpus uh kind of grows when you publish things and so there are going to be you know agent flows and Bot flows that go and create more content and new content um but for the on the retrieval side that a lot of those queries are going to get sucked in to you know powering some result right and then that result gets re-indexed it gets re-indexed and now people are speculating it's going to pollute the search indexes to the point of absurdity somebody like yourself or some group of people offshore uh just like they created content Farms they could literally just start creating they could create an AI right now with chatgpt that registers 100 new domains a day makes a hundred different recipes and then articles about those recipes and then does the same thing every day until there are so many recipe sites that the internet is flooded with garbage and nobody knows which one actually works yeah Google kind of knows Google knows well they have they have the original index I have yeah and they they can detect AI generate content overall they're how do they do that how do they generate how do they know it's um chat GPT generated there are signatures in the outputs that that allow you to calculate um it's a perplexity score sometimes and that's that's an actual measurement of How likely the next word is is to follow the previous one got it so it's too perfect and you can you can like make it not be as perfect just by giving it certain instructions and say mix it up a little bit I think this is how they they caught the chess cheater kid was he was doing the book move yes he was like accurate yeah how often does somebody do the book move and I play in the chest.com thing and it will tell you like this is the book move this is the you know game very optimal move basically and if everybody's doing game very optimal so now you have to put something in a randomized to not do game very optimal so maybe at some point it figures that out you know what's interesting though they said when the digital camera came out uh that this would change Hollywood Forever that digital filmmakers and Wayne Wang did a digital film um and Bennett Miller had done a digital film on this is all on the VX 1000 I believe was the name of the Sony camera one yeah it became super popular in the late 90s in New York and all these and skateboarding and skateboarding yes well skateboarders use it right yeah and it was like this thing is so good that when you blow it up and you put it on a projector you can't kind of tell or most audiences can't tell a cinematographer obviously could and then there were filters in you know different pieces of software that would make it look even better anyway the point was because you don't have to worry about film stock developing it the cost just got sucked out of this you could record forever even a bad actor could just keep take doing different takes you would get there and it didn't actually change the world I mean it did create YouTube it did create a lot of other content so maybe a nuts extended but it didn't change film so what's different about that argument than your argument for um you know AI replacing everything well the iPhone one right I found one the Camera World it destroyed it I also went music so my my like base case is that Apple wins probably this too to a large degree one because the phones are powerful enough and the models are going to shrink small enough that they can fit on a phone and so even some of these image generation models they can fit now on the phone text gen and same thing on a long enough time frame they will fit on the phone and um I think that you know that's always crazy but then people just get used to it they're like oh yeah iPhone 20 will have whatever it is native well just like laptops now have Wi-Fi built in there was a time you had to add Bluetooth with a dongle or Wi-Fi with a dongle or a PCM CIA card whatever that was called you know you'd have different card slots on your laptop to put in different peripherals now it's all on a chip somewhere and you don't have to do anything for it exactly I have one more Point here so my kids my kids are eight and five and they just think computers can generate images just totally natural to them you know in in the um I think it's adults and people that have struggled to use computers they're adult lives it's like this is these are the people that have you know a challenge like accepting that AI is going to power computers to do these tasks for us but kids and kids are like yeah of course of course yeah of course it's going to yeah I mean it's just like well it's so obvious that a computer could do it to them that it's not even special or interesting you know if you're of the age where you remember the internet uh happening in Broadband um and there was a moment in time where I was on a college campus in the late 80s and I had seen higher speed internet speeds bitnat and arpanet and people only had dial-ups I was using dial up at home but I was like you know this this can get a lot faster there are faster systems than this and I had installed token ring and Banyan Vines and then eventually ethernet in local area networks were like you know this thing's going to be able to carry images and pictures and sound and eventually video and so it's kind of the same thing like you your limitation right now that you're like oh it can produce interesting copy that's Sometimes good sometimes bad okay images and once in a while a three second looped video I mean you're gonna be able to talk to this thing and just make your own Star Wars story and it'll be indistinguishable then I don't know the original series or whatever 10 years ago series without any polish on it I mean that basically is doesn't take much of a jump actually only takes a huge jump if you haven't watched rapid change right well I think in the next year you'll see it um probably just take over business in general so we know it can generate business ideas we know it can create websites from an idea we know it can figure out who the core Persona is for that service we know it can access the apis that would retrieve right who the target contacts are we know it can write personalized emails to them right so it's going to come up with an idea you make your SAS startup and then it starts selling it for you it's it's in the same one big sequence I promise yeah that's all it is so that's all that is here today it's just a matter of infrastructure and that's something we're working on right now so what I mean what you've described means your own business because it's commodified so are you saying that your own business is gonna or your or are you saying your business will be commodified every 24 months and you'll just have to extend it no I'd say like most businesses are not commoditized by that Loop you know most businesses have some kind of like real world thing happening let's say like JP Morgan right that's not you can't really replicate JP Morgan with that kind of system but there are a lot of one services that can be replicated like Specialists Consulting a lot of that stuff can be replicated a lot of software companies can be replicated yeah I mean you're talking about regulation I mean you could I mean somebody's going to put Ai and web three point web3 together in crypto and be like make me a crypto that does X Y and Z they're trying to I mean they're trying to shut you know shut all that down with um regulation regulation the the crypto choke point yes if you F around too much you will find out what the government is capable of when you're a founder priority number one is hitting your payroll this means you need fast access to cash no matter what goes down so startups need to hold their money in more than just one FDIC in short account we all know that right been pretty choppy out there of late so let me tell you about Mayfair Mayfair is a cash fault powered by stripe and it's built for startups looking to diversify and grow their funds automatically takes 10 minutes to set up it works alongside your existing bank accounts and most importantly FDIC insured here's how it works you sign up for a new

listeners that sign up today earn 4.35 yield on their daily balances that's more than 10 times the national average savings account go to get mayfair.com twist to start managing your cash like a Fortune 500 company today that's getmayfair.com twist okay so show me copy Ai and what it's doing today because you and I were talking at South by uh and I was like huh a lot of the stuff you showed me is now built into chat gpt4 what does that do for your business yeah so I'll give you that same question which is hey you know the stuff you were talking about two years ago to your credit I literally put everybody in my company I said everybody has homework this weekend we're a finance company we all work six seven days a week if you don't like it don't work at a finance company um and I said just spend an hour or two playing with uh chat gbt and um tell me on Monday how it helps you do your job faster better or I wanted to come back with uh the sales team started doing prospecting in it and other people started doing marketing plans in it and I haven't gone through everybody's responses but uh the my team on this podcast has been doing podcast notes with it and that works really well which we thought was a goof 60 days ago when chat GPT 3.5 came out I was like just ask you what the revenue of this you know Netflix was the last five years and it was wrong and then chatgpt4 comes out it's like okay it's right so it's starting to things that we even noticed three months ago four months ago were wrong so you could and then we asked it to take you know um we will take a zoom recording of a meeting with a Founder transcribe it and this past week we took the transcripts which now Zoom is doing and then we had chat cpt4 summarize it and summarize it in three different lengths so now in our notion instance not only do we have the video with the interview with the founder recorded we have the transcript and then I guess two or three versions of it so I could read the short version of it and I was like it's pretty accurate I mean I wouldn't rely on it to make an investment decision but certainly would be interesting to read before you meet with the founder what about gpt5 you have to assume gpt5 will be extremely less error prone and you will just trust it just like GPS the first GPS remember people ran off the side of Roads be like turn left and somebody would wind up in a cornfield like it said turn left and it's like exactly dummy you still have to look just also like autopilot it's like oh it's gonna stop at this red light unless like there's a Christmas tree at the red light you know confusing it um but it feels like you can trust it I think trust is going to be the main issue is can I trust this by default yes can I trust it more than a human and I trust self-driving on a highway more than I trust a human today yes yeah and we're we went through the that Valley where the quality was lower than people can produce and that was like the gpt3 valley and that's where a lot of people are saying oh well the content's terrible and like it's awful quality and it's just gonna pollute the internet that's a very short duration until you basically can replicate all the steps that a person would go through to write a high quality article just replicate that at scale and I think one of the one of the key um one of the key points that even chat gpt3 is not it's kind of missing right now is the scalability component so in order for you to get value out of it you have to manually query it you know so your marketing team has to say okay we're gonna go do this or your sales team is manually configuring it the the area of opportunity for you know in our kind of viewpoint of the future is really scaled fully automated um workflows so you give the AI uh you kind of tell it what you want to do or or over time just give it access to your systems and then it will go and configure itself and it will try to improve your business for you autonomously so you can't really get there from chat and so but part of the back end infrastructure is very similar because in the world of autonomous business process agents that is like an agent billing platform and so you do need to say Okay I want to do this here's here that here's the list of tools you have access to go do it now instead of reporting back to me report back to yourself and then figure out how you can improve from there right so what you want to do is is build these um you know extend the data flows that you have coming off of your current software stack so you have a newsletter right yep what do you do with the information uh the data that comes out of the newsletter performance nothing don't care right so is there value there sure right and it's and it usually comes down to you like the team just doesn't have enough time to do everything right it's an afterthought to think about and to coach yourself there's no person on there so you could say every time the newsletter comes out at the end of the week tell us which stories got the most clicks and then what are stories like those that we can do more of boom and that's a set every week and it just sends them an agent so it's like Google alerts or magic leap had this idea that you'd have agents out there doing things for you but if you take a Google alert which is on your last name or your company name this is a googler that can do more advanced things yeah exactly and and even the newsletter maybe you have like very high value contacts in your in your newsletter database sure yeah right and you're like hey I actually want to personalize theirs so I want to take this content and just literally personalize it down like one to one to them because I want every single message they get from us to be extremely high quality ah interesting right so those are systems that are going to be you're going to be able to build we're building out um we have pilot Enterprise partners that we're working with now that are deploying some of these workflows into their existing business processes fascinating the they're the thing that compounds is once we set up a workflow um let's call it like the newsletter use case most newsletters would need it and so that is the thing that we're gonna copy a template in your library like motion has templates or other platform as templates and yeah that gets super interesting in a creative we did uh just as an example here's a couple of you know when we do when the when our researchers are going to do a Google search like I'm doing a live show and they're like hey when did Netflix launch when did it pass 100 million Subs when did Disney plus launch when it allows do 100 Subs it's now getting that right it wasn't getting that right previously but here's examples of chat gbt doing that um and it does seem like barred from Google which I've been playing with has more recent information so in your mind how far behind is bard do you think in reality um probably the the measure that matters is the user base for for the chat programs I think that would that would be the the Difference Maker there that ultimately will determine who wins so then Google does win because even if openai has tens of millions of users Google has billions across Chrome Android YouTube Etc so Google wins I wouldn't count anybody out I wouldn't count Google out I mean Google has they have all the data sets that matter yep so they should be able to go faster and have the users and they have the browsers they have to really get their Vision together about what they're building and for them you know their goal was to make um you know all human knowledge accessible and useful that was like their mission statement and search does that right it does that along one dimension which is you can search for something so it's like I'm gonna pull information out and they show you the list of links which is great however the the idea that it's making it useful I think they've they're failing to deliver on that function the output that you get back that and then also just think about how much value is not sitting on the internet that you don't know about that would create value for you right and until now we've never had a way like a technology that could take all of that information and directly apply it and make your thing more valuable whatever it is you've built and have been working on right so even for for you you know your the media company content company you're trying to read a lot of stuff and figure out what's important what's valuable and they're and I'm sure in the past it's called four weeks you see more launches than you can even keep up with oh it's crazy I mean the number of people launching verticalized AI like if I had a nickel for every company that's going to respond to sales emails or customer support emails in a better fashion I mean it's in the hundreds now yeah right and and the thing we ran into we were trying to build verticalized Solutions and we've we realized that it's it's just uh it's basically the same back-end infrastructure that you need to do any of them and so rather than a large let's say bank trying to evaluate 3 000 vertical wise solution providers they'll they'll end up opting just for a platform and you've seen this happen over and over again so segment was a CDP layer customer day layer that they didn't have to build snowflake was a huge like data you know Data Warehouse in the cloud they didn't have to build that service now one of their Originals right just scaled so hard and they were very use case agnostic and that's that's very appealing for large companies because they're always trying to reduce the number of of tools that they have at the company level yeah for sure so that's I mean Microsoft Office perfect example yeah bundling of stuff so show us your product and where you're at with it and what people are using the most and it and specifically how does it differ from Chad gpt4 because as I said my premise was or my question to you was was like is this thing eventually Collide or are you just in an arms race where they're building this sort of web-based service and then they need people like you to build stuff on top of it yeah it works both ways I think there's plenty of room in in this you know in these categories this is our chat products we've connected it to the internet let's ask it so this you know svb got sold today yep and so this would be you know real-time query that we can run it um you know most people were using like our these tools here a second so over time all the latency drops and the costs drop and so for the uh for this result you know you're getting the actual articles right and through the citations you're surfing that web so you have Google news or some news feeds that interior using chat t4s like hey go check the web we can do anything we could do any of it we want so you can hit like you can do it in real time you can do like a search API that you can add add to the back end you can use the being API um that stuff doesn't really matter too much like you do any anything you want and then you can bring all those results back in and for for this one you know it answer the question really fast yeah right and when gbt3 launched it would make something up it would just literally make up like the wrong answer and be very confident in it yeah right what's the word for that is that what they mean when they say it's delusional or hallucination hallucination yeah it thinks it's right it has no idea yeah okay so this is impressive what next so what's happening in the back end is actually where the secret sauce gets built so when you and you know when a user comes in a chat and they ask a question the you know in the Google world it would just hit up its index so the index would say okay what's the closest set of results that I should show to this user based on that query in the generative world you can build these agents so you can go try to solve the problem and the more tools you give that agent the AI agent the better it can solve the problem so it is choosing now what route to take so these are not pre-programmed steps that you build into it so so it's saying I could go to Wikipedia I could go to Google news or Bing news or I could search the open web I could do a web crawl I could do excuse me any number of things I search Twitter search Reddit or quora and it somehow figures out you know what this news service is better or is it blending the new service with the web search it's going to do a little bit it can do whatever it wants yeah so this is a fundamentally a new way of building back-ends to Software the other thing that you know ours can do is it can recommend new steps so it can add you know we can figure out what tools it wants and we can give it access to more tools so in some cases people wanted access to like LinkedIn data right so we can go get a link an API that queries LinkedIn profiles and returns that and it's like a Json format which is like a data format and then now we can take that information and do something with it that's relevant to that user this is going to make these large data sets um invaluable and if you're going to use them you're going to need to get a licensing fee from LinkedIn Reddit quora maybe you could talk about what's going on in the back Channel because you're probably facing this yourself with those discussions I understand there's like multiple lawsuits about to drop on open AI for using various platforms data without explicit permission and once you start charging for stuff and you take 10 billion from Microsoft you can no longer be like oh it's an academic non-profit even non-profits like I don't know if you saw the Wayback machine the internet archive lost its copyright case that's a non-profit so this is clearly unfair use um no I don't know if it breaks the fair use will have like there'll be a big debate coming up but what's the back Channel right now about who gets access to quora Reddit Twitter pick a data set um and how will that hash out in your mind what's the Fair Route there that's a good question I think over time you know the like I mean licensing tends to get figured out over time yes music industry they figured it out even in the image generation side now I was at South by Southwest and at the Shutterstock booth and they had an AI generated image product and even them even though you're using AI to generate it they would find the images that went into the generation and they will pay a royalty to the copyright holder of that of those images yeah getting images suing stable diffusion right now uh yeah a bunch of Open Source developers are showing Microsoft's GitHub co-pilot so these those are the to me those were like very they should get sued at least um the the code base I think I would at least want to see like how those arguments play out so if you open source your code someone grabs it trains a model and it can is replicating your code verbatim and even in some cases like the you know the script the documentation script that was personalized to you I mean that's very traceable right yeah and that's the reason not to put citations in it why wouldn't you right so that that same thing happened on the initial stable diffusion data set so they did you know they grabbed images and you could see like Getty in the watermark The Watermark so we we kind of avoided doing image gen a lot of other platforms wanted to launch that as products but if uh you know any of these image generators they'll produce copyright and content and the way the copyright laws work is if you are the one that generated it on your servers and you're selling it like that's a you're gonna get deemed for that yeah and that's it's a derivative product that you created now if I were to load uh just like on my browser I can take my browser I can save a web page on my desktop but that's fair use um and I can even edit the web page on my desktop it's when I choose to put it out in Commerce that your copyright gets uh you know has problems but if I were to if I were to download the original chat TPT open source and it's no longer open source it's just like chat gpt4 is not open source now when did it stop being open source gpt3 is not open source so three and a half which powered chat not open source for not open source and it's unlikely that open AI will open source is there what's the number one competing product and how far behind were they because it would it seems the world needs an open source version of this and if I would have run the open source version on my cluster of servers or you know my desktop my phone and pointed out a data set that I had access to well that's for my own personal use uh nobody can stop me right you can do that and even the stable diffusion models they've they've shrunk them down they can fit on your my MacBook or your phone so no you know no kind of copyright issue there but if you try to monetize that you do run into it in terms of Open Source um open AI is still say the art um for their for their core foundational models um they the advantage actually is not on the training side it's it's the computational intensity side so it's how they optimize their Hardware how they optimize the training of the models that's where you build a really compounding competitive Advantage because the bottleneck across the world right now is GPU capacity capacity and availability so Nvidia has back orders like crazy for their h100 GPU it's a really expensive GPU so like a graphical you know processing unit and it was you know it's what powers video games it does a lot of um kind of Matrix math and that's what you know these neural Nets really need that at at scale and anytime a big company wants to launch an AI powered product that's just more compute that's needed to serve that up and um I think most people have run into like outages Chad GPT goes down or open AI goes down um it's a function of like the limitations of you know just not having enough of these gpus uh in their server Farm and getting overlooked but isn't the tensor stuff all Open Source Hardware as well so other people should be able to build these and compete over time no um Nvidia has you know they make Custom Modified chips for for folks and they competed pretty hard Google did have the the tpus the tensor processing units but those have not really performed for for the applications in the the same way for other companies this is not my area of expertise no I I mean I'm hearing people talk about the shortage now and it does seem like it's an opportunity for you know massive competition again open source and another technology you know that Hardware is made and you know like tsmc Taiwan it's my conductor and that's a whole geopolitical risk too and um it's pretty amazing that we've been talking about this invasion of Taiwan now for you know close to a decade but that has gotten more and more heated the last couple years and that um increased tension seems to parallel the development of AI and uh covid yeah I don't know that's that is like you know Taiwan built itself on the back of its semiconductor industry because that was the thing that would get the most protection from the US yeah over time and that was a good bet that was a good call on that but I think even tsmc is saying hey maybe we need to diversify a little bit and start opening up Fabs in the US oh and they are yeah India everywhere yep it's absolutely fantastic so show me your product before we wrap up here in run out of time uh any other pieces you want to show any other like things you're super proud of I mean it's super impressive um and I understand now the difference uh yours is doing a lot more inputs in the way it's kind of like zapier or if this than that kind of is built into it natively so it can go find more sources dynamically yeah it can go do that and then I think you know over time and this is what I was getting to about software in general you know you could you've bought software for your team before right sure and then what happens if the team doesn't use the software to its fullest potential we unsubscribe at some point hopefully somebody remembers they put it on a credit card but I cancel our cards every year where I have the cards that you can set the limit on where like I just say okay take all the cards down to zero and let's watch our phones ring off the hook as SAS vendors are like hey your card's not working that that definitely works and one of the the big the big shift here is when you move away from software and towards agents the agents know how to use these tools better than people do and so they're going to extract all the value out of these tools and that it could be apis that could be really anything and you're seeing it across the board in all these little pointed Solutions but imagine wrapping all those Point Solutions into a generalized platform that's that's what we're building makes sense yeah this is uh pretty crazy well listen you had a team of 30 or 40 over there 35. yeah I mean uh you raised some a decent amount of cash and you got a decent amount of Revenue coming in are you finding your clients are this is you're you're too far ahead of what they need or they're just trying to get understand this or now with chat gbt354 they're all like oh my God we have to catch up I know we paid for this we need to now expand it and we need to understand this because our bosses are breathing down our uh throats it it's a mix so yeah there there's an AI maturity model Gartner published this model in 2019 and they said hey look we're going to start by companies kind of being interested in different you know potential with AI yeah the I've taken that and adapted their maturity model and basically that phase one is like the end users are gonna start bringing in different AI tools into their day-to-day workflows so that would be like people using chat gbt using our chat yeah that's also powered by Chad GPT or um you know using copywriting tools I saw canva Adobe you know everybody's got a motion everybody's got an AI feature kind of a wizard yeah which which was you know I think it took two years and probably the 3.5 model was really the point where those companies would say okay we can we feel okay trusting this and putting this out there for our customers um so that's really phase one is are your is your team using it the second piece would be is your team able to actually scale its usage of AI and that's not something that chat GPT is going to really help your team do but if you wanted to make you know repeatable processes uh build you know build actual components of your business so focusing on the system rather than the manual tasks automation um so that's where you know we built into that that's kind of phase two and then phase three is when you connect you begin to connect enough of the workflows together so that the data feedback loop starts to really run like a flywheel and at that point now more and more of your business is going into odd like autonomous mode and as you exit as you go into autonomous mode people have to actually build that system out and it and it's not the AI team but it's actually the business users people The Business Leaders even the functional people a lot of people want want to actually build these systems out and so you are seeing kind of two groups emerge one they're excited about you know building more efficient systems being able to do more projects than their you know their team could have ever done before and they're the ones that are really AI native and that's who we build for and then you have folks that are really hesitant to adopt in any of the systems and tooling and ultimately those companies are not going to be competitive kind of in the 12 to 18 month time frame they're gonna become rapidly uncompetitive and then pretty much at every company the CEO is like hey AI is here like what's our AI plan what's our AI strategy right yeah and so then there's a really big gap between the end user tool and the CEO yeah right and so where we found success with our platform is selling the vision of the platform to the like CEO c-suite and then the leaders of all those groups because they say okay well can you can you do this use case can you do this use case can you it's like yes yes yes because it's all basically just stacking these blocks together and um that'll cover that I mean that could be a 10-year time frame where that really gets adopted or it could be like three years five years it really depends on um the level one of interest and then two it's like how fast is the underlying technology really going to improve um right now the bottleneck is people don't even know what's possible with AI yet so there is a key and that's why I just told everybody start playing with it and it's kind of like mobile you know one of the first steps people did in Mobile was or even Cloud was just give everybody a mobile phone so everybody had flip phones and they're like just get everybody on your team on mobile phone get everybody your team an iPad if you want to build iPad apps they got at least have iPad if you want to see what 5G and broadband's like just buy all your Executives Broadband at home and get them laptops and show them how it works right they need to really start soaking it and playing with it and and then the use cases will come out and it's like anything else some people will go too slow like Microsoft did with mobile and they'll give more videos they didn't miss this one I mean this is like the makeup for missing mobile right you think about having a family they miss mobile and now how well they hit this one they're like we're not going to miss this one we'll pay 10 billion and then you look at like Mark Zuckerberg with ar VR or maybe to a lesser stunt Apple who has advice coming maybe they just also made huge bets and those huge bets are just not going to hit the mark so yeah it's uh one of the great things about technology is how Dynamic it is all right listen Paul you're in a you're amazing uh really great overview for people who don't know about it and if you're in the business of running a business I think that's as plainly as you can say copy AI might be able to help you be more efficient so go check it out we have free plants there's a free plan goes to go play with it and until your free plan uh you use up all your credits and then uh you go or what do you do multiplayer mode is where you have to pay we're doing uh right now it's still credits because it yeah yeah it's a little pricey for us oh it is pricey yeah yeah I mean I thought open AI dropped the price like 100 or 90 or something they did they that saved that saved us pretty good yeah that was it was going to be quite expensive and they'll do that again I guess I bet right yeah over time it's going to go to zero and so then you'll have the scale the volumes will really start to to work through the system and that's another reason that I wouldn't want to focus on the end user Point Solutions because you won't have enough volume over time to really Propel a business yeah it's incredible to think about you know something about because there is so it's so easy to create companies and you're seeing this AI hype race right but then the durability of a lot of the point Solutions is really going to be questionable I think well I also think you have to also want and have the motivation and when human motivation this is a very hard reality for most people especially woke people or people who want to believe the world is fair in some way like it really does break their brain when you're like okay now solve for motivation because I can take any course from MIT or Harvard or Stanford online for free right now and so the world's unfair and those Ivy League schools have now given all their information out for free or the vx100 you can buy a used one and make a movie and so Hollywood's holding you back or you could get three or four of your friends together and make a movie this weekend or a short film for free what's holding you back and that's what I learned over time is that human creativity is all there but motivation that fire in your belly the desire to go do something sometimes the unhealthy Obsession and desire to go do something that's one that we still as much abundance as we have can't seem to solve for we can't make people motivated to go change the world some people are and some people aren't my my oldest daughter I asked her like what do you want to do you know when you grow up and she's like well I want to want to breed dogs and I want to do art I'm like sweet I said you can do that now like you don't need to go to college yeah dog breeder or make art and that sounds like a pretty girl she said she said I'll breed dogs and then I'll sell the dogs and I use the money to buy more art supplies yeah and buy more dogs right so I think if if I could have one wish it would be that when we do go update the curriculums of schools yeah that the only thing that we instill is like that creativity and getting things done that you care about and if you drive that passion forward everyone will be successful because you'll have unlimited tools to make things happen there's literally in a school of um Academia so there's Montessori and then there's something called Reggio and Reggio the one of the Core Concepts is uh Regio Emilia is figure out what the child is motivated by and then have the curriculum taught through that in your case art supplies and art and puppies uh and and dog breeding so you could teach biology obviously through dog breeding and you can teach math and you teach science through the science of oil painting or sculpture and you know the physics of it you can teach anything through a lens in which somebody's you know if somebody's into skiing you could teach them physics of skiing and they would learn all the physics Concepts but they would be super motivated and then teaching physics abstractly they're not motivated turns out every kid could learn physics or pick a topic if you just put it in the right wrapper um but yeah the education system is broken I just we should just ask copy AI right now how to fix the education system I'm sure it has a great answer well you can do custom you know custom learning plans for people people already building those those systems out and even like linking to the right YouTube video to watch that's awesome yeah if announce that it's incredible yeah at some point it'll be like hey where what is this person stuck on you know like some kids lost in life they're like oh this kid's lost like okay let's figure out some assessment tool and then it's like okay here's what would motivate this kid uh watch these five videos and it's like watch this Gladiator video watch this like skiing video watch this puppy video and then listen to this song in a second it's gonna unlock their brain and unstuck them that'd be awesome that'd be pretty pretty great all right listen we'll see everybody next time on this week in startups bye bye everybody
