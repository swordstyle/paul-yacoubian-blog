[00:02] [Music]
[00:04] thank you so much for joining us today i
[00:07] know that first of all i became aware of
[00:10] your company because heaton shaw was
[00:14] just going nuts and i've known peyton
[00:15] for many many years on twitter i used to
[00:18] be in the valley okay for most of my for
[00:21] most of my 30s i spent there and then i
[00:23] decided to come home to miami about two
[00:26] years ago pre-pandemic and then now it's
[00:28] a little crazy
[00:30] silicon valley with you you know what
[00:33] i don't know we'll see i you know it's
[00:35] there's a lot of stuff happening on
[00:37] twitter
[00:38] but uh we'll see if it actually happens
[00:40] like you know silicon valley has
[00:42] sustained the the test of time for a
[00:45] very long time for
[00:46] a lot of reasons and not just because of
[00:48] a couple vcs and stuff like that so
[00:51] we'll see listen i i would love there to
[00:53] be an uh a massive ecosystem that
[00:55] happens here that has half of the
[00:57] success that the valley has had but yeah
[01:00] we'll see i know that our world has
[01:02] changed quite a bit and so i think that
[01:04] it doesn't have to be silicon valley it
[01:06] could be you know what they're calling
[01:07] miami tech now or whatnot
[01:09] right but uh but yeah as long as there's
[01:12] you know it's fun and and we're
[01:14] supporting each other um that's what i
[01:16] care about but let's talk a little bit
[01:18] about yourself why don't you take a
[01:19] quick second to introduce yourself tell
[01:21] us a little bit about copy.ai and you
[01:24] know what what the hell did were you
[01:26] thinking to get on this journey
[01:28] yeah so i've been a founder am a venture
[01:32] capitalist for the past five years with
[01:34] my co-founder chris liu
[01:36] so we had helped employees exercise
[01:38] stock options at venture-backed
[01:40] companies and so we had seen hundreds of
[01:42] companies
[01:43] and had invested in hundreds of
[01:44] companies as well
[01:46] and he and i have been looking for the
[01:48] next big wave in tech and trying to
[01:50] figure out what the next frontier would
[01:52] be
[01:53] and when gpt2 launched in 2019 it was
[01:56] pretty clear to me that it would be
[01:59] increasingly powerful and that its
[02:01] creativity was off the charts so when
[02:03] gpt3 launched this past summer
[02:06] and we saw these amazing demos on
[02:08] twitter we knew that this is this could
[02:11] be it this could be the next big wave so
[02:13] we started building these little side
[02:15] projects
[02:16] and trying to figure out okay is there a
[02:18] market for this
[02:19] um and my hunch was that it was it was a
[02:22] good enough model that you could have a
[02:25] commercially viable product with it
[02:27] so the fourth mvp we launched was
[02:29] copy.ai we launched it on twitter we had
[02:33] 2 000 free signups the first two days of
[02:36] launch
[02:37] and those started to convert to paying
[02:38] customers and then pretty soon we knew
[02:40] that we'd have like a real startup to
[02:43] launch
[02:44] and so
[02:45] we quit our jobs and we transitioned out
[02:47] and started building this full-time and
[02:50] here we are about less than five months
[02:52] later we've had 60 000 a month in
[02:55] recurring revenue
[02:56] and uh we're making our our third higher
[02:59] this week so
[03:01] things are going well you know so and
[03:04] the product is very much product led
[03:07] right like you know i've signed up to it
[03:09] i'm probably going to start using it at
[03:12] our our new company um reprise and
[03:15] because i'm heading up content and stuff
[03:17] like that there
[03:18] you know when you think about that
[03:20] journey early on
[03:22] and you decided first of all we're going
[03:25] to go product led and we want this to be
[03:27] a self-serve for a variety of reasons
[03:30] what was kind of the the mindset when
[03:32] you decided
[03:34] we're going to do this thing self-serve
[03:36] at least you know have that tier go to
[03:38] market with that as opposed to
[03:41] we're going to build out something
[03:42] that's going to be a little more
[03:43] sales-led or human-led and maybe we're
[03:46] going to go up market and good you know
[03:48] out of the out of the box like start to
[03:50] get you know five figure deals and those
[03:52] sort of things
[03:53] yeah we didn't think about that
[03:55] at the time
[03:57] it was mostly like hey what what little
[03:59] thing can we build and test
[04:02] and when you do it that way
[04:04] and you have 2 000 signups i mean you're
[04:05] not thinking about going up market
[04:08] you're really thinking about oh i'll
[04:09] just add some stripe subscription
[04:11] integration and then i'm done that's
[04:14] obviously product led
[04:15] and then the question is is that going
[04:17] to be enough
[04:18] to sustain a company or
[04:20] do you just put the sales hat on and try
[04:23] to go to market that way
[04:25] and win one deal after the next and um
[04:29] yeah so for us
[04:30] we didn't have to even get to that point
[04:32] it just kind of worked um
[04:35] from from the bottoms up
[04:37] um with the product led growth which has
[04:39] been amazing because that's that's a
[04:40] great feature to have for a business
[04:42] model right
[04:43] yeah like it can it can scale as long as
[04:46] hard as you want so
[04:48] it's not dependent on us
[04:49] you know doing a lot of
[04:51] outreach and a lot of custom building
[04:54] really nice well i mean first of all
[04:57] that's that's the holy grail right if
[05:00] you can get that you know how many
[05:01] companies for so long have been trying
[05:03] to go product led you know even before
[05:05] this category which i think is probably
[05:07] about
[05:08] you know four years five years old i i
[05:11] would say is when i started to see
[05:13] the folks over at openview start to talk
[05:15] about it and vlog about it but you know
[05:17] people have been really trying to do it
[05:18] and i feel like it's it's really really
[05:21] difficult because it's so very close to
[05:23] a lot of the motions that you would have
[05:25] to go through uh within a like a
[05:27] consumer b2c app right but but b2b as
[05:31] well so i i think in one side it's like
[05:34] easier to be able to say okay well let's
[05:36] fix that problem within
[05:38] the uh enterprise or within an
[05:40] organization on the other side it's all
[05:43] right well
[05:44] how do we get it
[05:45] to like grow itself right were there any
[05:48] initial sort of tactics or
[05:50] strategies you use to
[05:53] to like you know set the set this on
[05:55] fire i mean 2000 sign ups right away is
[05:57] pretty good man well we yeah i mean i've
[05:59] been on twitter like not heavily but
[06:02] more heavily like increasingly heavy for
[06:04] like 18 months
[06:06] no maybe 12 months leading up to that so
[06:09] since we kept launching things each time
[06:11] we launch we get more followers and then
[06:13] i think at about 2 000 by the time
[06:15] i launched and then i asked everybody
[06:17] that i followed basically to retweet it
[06:19] or like it like hey watch this would
[06:21] appreciate your support
[06:23] and that helped propel it and then i
[06:24] think it got picked up in the twitter
[06:26] algorithm too because we got a little
[06:27] bit more reach with that one
[06:30] um
[06:32] so yeah that was like
[06:34] that's a that's a really great way to
[06:36] kick off a large product launch you know
[06:39] yeah so was it very much like hey our go
[06:42] to market is twitter and focused on
[06:45] twitter at least initial yeah the
[06:47] initial kickoff was that for sure and
[06:50] did you find that like hashtags
[06:53] uh those sort of things were were
[06:55] valuable or just really just driving
[06:57] engagement
[06:58] yeah
[06:59] engagement yeah yeah be it be
[07:01] interesting i mean that's it yeah
[07:04] well dude i i follow you and you know
[07:07] i've been following you for months now
[07:08] and i've just been seeing the mrr move
[07:11] up and that tweet alone is [ __ ]
[07:14] badass man yeah that's a good thing
[07:16] you look good yeah that one probably
[07:18] gets pretty pretty good engagement
[07:20] doesn't it it does i tried to stick some
[07:22] more some more content in it now so it's
[07:24] not just the mrr although occasionally
[07:26] i'll do it so
[07:28] today's was um you know 60k mrr and then
[07:32] like a space and then the next line said
[07:34] hired again
[07:36] number three builds in public on twitter
[07:38] the rocket ship
[07:40] like it's getting people excited we were
[07:42] literally recruiting from twitter so
[07:44] anyone that follows us
[07:46] should
[07:46] should be seeing this you know hey who
[07:48] wants to work on something cool like i'm
[07:50] literally on twitter hiring people
[07:53] that's amazing you know well look at
[07:55] what the city of miami mayor just did
[07:57] right like it's very similar right yeah
[08:00] and so so there's a little story there
[08:02] he's married to my cousin gloria and uh
[08:06] um like
[08:07] you know of course i hadn't seen gloria
[08:08] in 20 years because i've been in new
[08:11] york and the bay area for a while
[08:13] and uh and so like i pinged him when i
[08:16] got back
[08:17] and i was like hey you know i'm in tech
[08:19] or you know i forgot exactly what i said
[08:21] but i said you know i really would like
[08:23] to help the ecosystem here and get
[08:25] involved because he's always been like
[08:27] known to be forward thinking and then a
[08:29] week later this whole like can i help
[08:32] whatever tweet that went viral and i
[08:34] haven't been able to get in touch with
[08:36] him ever since but but it's so [ __ ]
[08:38] interesting it's like twitter
[08:40] is
[08:42] has it got there i mean i worked at
[08:43] twitter you know and we were still
[08:45] trying to figure it out early on
[08:47] um and this was
[08:49] nine years ago right right no okay so
[08:52] twitter yeah i yeah i've studied it i've
[08:55] studied it somewhere and then i've
[08:56] studied it some more
[08:58] and the thing is yes
[09:00] like everything in life is about finding
[09:04] a point of leverage and
[09:06] and basically extracting maximum
[09:08] leverage out of something
[09:10] and usually
[09:11] there's going to be one channel that
[09:12] works better than any other channel and
[09:14] you dominate it like you really go get
[09:17] all of it
[09:18] so for
[09:20] anyone like for mayor suarez like
[09:24] it's so easy
[09:26] it's like
[09:27] this brain dead obvious growth channel
[09:31] he can get
[09:33] you know keith your boys to town
[09:36] he he just got peter teal to town
[09:39] to at least live there
[09:41] they bring like their friends to at
[09:43] least buy a house whether or not they're
[09:45] there full-time
[09:46] they start tweeting about hey we're down
[09:48] here
[09:49] you know hey
[09:50] like keith's been having meetings like
[09:52] he said non-stop for six months
[09:54] nine nine am to nine pm every day
[09:56] face-to-face meetings
[09:58] you have this the tax base advantage and
[10:00] you have like uh the beach yeah so those
[10:04] are really
[10:05] great advantages and and they've been
[10:07] able to pick up you know some new work a
[10:09] lot of new york
[10:10] momentum but i'd say the big thing is
[10:12] tech
[10:13] and
[10:14] what the pandemics proved is that you
[10:16] can build a company anywhere you don't
[10:17] have to be in san francisco so if that's
[10:19] the case
[10:21] then you're not stuck in san francisco
[10:23] no one's stuck you can move and live
[10:24] with wherever you want and when that
[10:26] happens
[10:27] then it's not about
[10:29] access to talent and that that stuff
[10:31] it's lifestyle and culture
[10:33] and that's where
[10:35] i don't think silicon valley is really
[10:38] thinking that through like what kind of
[10:41] what kind of cultural
[10:43] you know art what kind of culture and
[10:45] like quality of life are we really
[10:47] offering
[10:48] and if the answer is not much or it's
[10:50] not very good
[10:52] or people don't feel like they're
[10:54] appreciated and it's in a place where
[10:56] they're generating almost all the wealth
[10:59] and the equity
[11:00] then that the talent's going to leave
[11:02] the talent's going to go somewhere where
[11:03] they want to be
[11:04] so
[11:05] they you know suarez picked up this
[11:08] beautiful momentum
[11:10] my my best performing tweet of all of
[11:13] last year was about
[11:14] miami it was in may
[11:16] i said just talk to a prominent angel
[11:18] ambassador who's moving to miami you
[11:20] know cited
[11:21] uh
[11:22] low lower taxes like beachfront real
[11:26] estate and like
[11:27] better fiber internet or something like
[11:30] that
[11:31] you know
[11:32] it got like over 2 000 likes and so this
[11:35] this was like hitting
[11:37] this central nervous point on twitter
[11:40] and the reason i posted it was because i
[11:43] i had three friends moved down there
[11:46] just from sf
[11:47] to there within a two week period
[11:50] and none of them even knew that the
[11:52] other person had gone there they
[11:53] basically just went and rented an airbnb
[11:56] so i was trying to figure out like
[11:58] all right these people are
[12:00] great angel investors angel investors
[12:03] are all about early stage traction
[12:06] all about it so they can sense signal
[12:09] and they can predict trends way before
[12:11] everyone else
[12:12] so i started looking at the ecosystem
[12:14] figure out hey who else is down there
[12:16] and there were some really incredible
[12:17] tech people
[12:19] really incredible so
[12:22] you had like the founder of yaks the
[12:24] founder of digitalocean the founder of
[12:26] chewie's
[12:27] alexis sohanian was there which i didn't
[12:29] realize yeah i didn't know either jervin
[12:31] pichavar is there like that's already a
[12:34] crew they just were not really
[12:36] that's not really a part of the tech
[12:38] ecosystem down there and like the
[12:39] accelerators and whatnot
[12:41] um so i saw like
[12:43] we've got potential i'm like this is
[12:46] this is exciting cause i was looking at
[12:47] creating a founder's house down there it
[12:49] was but it was just too hard to rent a
[12:51] place because i had i had founders that
[12:53] wanted to go
[12:54] and like just room together i was like
[12:56] we could just take that promote it and
[12:58] do all sorts of stuff
[13:00] and then it was just too hard to get any
[13:03] real estate rentals yeah so we i skipped
[13:06] that you know okay this is interesting
[13:08] though i'm not going to focus on that
[13:10] let me go build some gt3 apps nice
[13:13] good call on that well listen yeah very
[13:15] good call but if you do want any real
[13:17] estate i can hook you up with my real
[13:19] estate guy
[13:20] yes i've known him since we were uh grew
[13:22] up together we were about 11 years old
[13:24] wow so he manages my property when uh
[13:27] that's awesome and i'm not around but
[13:29] let's talk a little bit about that
[13:31] transition because there's so many like
[13:33] early stage entrepreneurs who are you
[13:36] know playing with
[13:38] products or side projects and
[13:40] they're seeing a little traction and
[13:42] often you know sometimes you jump off
[13:44] the cliff too early and there's a
[13:46] variety of different issues with stress
[13:49] and
[13:50] runway and those sort of things where if
[13:52] you jump off too early
[13:54] you can really just kill the business to
[13:55] you know right away but if you're
[13:58] just doing this zombie thing where
[14:00] you're like you know phoning it in at
[14:02] work during the day and then coming home
[14:05] you know working till 3 a.m you know
[14:07] that's not going to get it either when
[14:09] did you know it was the right time to
[14:11] quit a great job you know as a vc and
[14:13] double down
[14:15] uh when i bet when we validated just the
[14:17] traction metrics so we knew what the
[14:20] paid conversion rate was we knew how
[14:21] many organic signups we were getting per
[14:23] day
[14:24] at that point i knew it was venture
[14:25] backable
[14:27] and we had maybe you know total spent
[14:29] like 40 hours building it
[14:32] which is nuts right it's not much
[14:35] because gpt3 is doing the work so we
[14:38] this is not typical i'd say most
[14:39] founders have
[14:41] are in that scenario that you laid out
[14:43] and there are hundreds of of people and
[14:46] that's in that situation right now
[14:48] on twitter
[14:49] and um
[14:51] my my intuition is that the problem is
[14:54] not the product necessarily it's their
[14:56] distribution
[14:58] and then their understanding of how to
[14:59] monetize
[15:01] i think if
[15:02] that's where the weaknesses are for most
[15:04] most of those people and then the third
[15:06] one would be
[15:07] understanding what a 10x product
[15:10] looks like
[15:11] so if you just listen to your customers
[15:13] and users you can get incremental
[15:15] improvements but it's not going to give
[15:17] you that
[15:18] big big big result that's going to
[15:21] like
[15:22] set off a chain reaction which you
[15:23] really need to have a big amount of
[15:25] traction
[15:26] so because my my co-founder chris and i
[15:28] we were
[15:29] you know we're investors so i have my
[15:31] own quantitative
[15:33] angel investing
[15:35] metrics like literally just calculate
[15:37] these numbers
[15:39] and i was like we don't get a good score
[15:40] chris
[15:43] i was like we fall short in two key
[15:45] areas i said one traction
[15:48] but i mean traction i'm not quitting my
[15:49] job until i get traction with something
[15:51] that's meaningful so we knew that which
[15:54] which meant i didn't have to
[15:55] like labor over do i quit my job or not
[15:59] right so just mentally
[16:00] that was really refreshing because you
[16:02] could have fun you could launch stuff
[16:03] and not take it so seriously
[16:07] and not
[16:09] labor over all that stuff um
[16:12] the second one was um
[16:17] the second one was we haven't worked at
[16:19] startups ourselves we've invested in
[16:22] early stage companies so our weakness
[16:24] will be building and managing a team
[16:28] so that's like
[16:30] the the thing we're going through now
[16:32] now that we've left but we knew that
[16:34] coming in so we were we were more
[16:36] hesitant to like go hire a bunch of
[16:38] people and
[16:39] just because we thought that would blow
[16:42] us up like we would not be able to
[16:44] manage it yeah so
[16:46] well that resonates pretty deeply with
[16:48] me just because yeah i've been on the
[16:50] other side of the coin where you know
[16:53] like uh
[16:54] i've always been an operator or a
[16:57] founder you know
[16:58] and
[17:00] i've made a thousand mistakes you know
[17:03] i'm 40 years old this year
[17:05] and um
[17:06] congratulations man thank you thank you
[17:08] i made it yeah i'm 33. all right
[17:12] well dude like when i was 33
[17:14] i was uh well not too long ago but i i
[17:18] was uh hacking on a startup of course in
[17:20] the valley broke
[17:22] uh yeah because
[17:24] actually you know what
[17:26] yeah was it
[17:27] no actually about 33 i was uh
[17:30] and we had sold the business to twitter
[17:32] so but i wasn't the founder i was the
[17:34] early early employees it was my one of
[17:36] my best friends companies and so you
[17:39] know he brought me in when they were
[17:40] like three founders i was the first hire
[17:42] and um i was always a really good first
[17:45] hire uh for
[17:47] non-technical stuff because at one point
[17:49] i was a nightclub promoter so i figured
[17:51] out how to do like promotions and yeah
[17:54] you know um and uh and events and then i
[17:58] was always a sales person i was a
[17:59] door-to-door sales person i had also
[18:02] started a couple software companies and
[18:04] and failed so you know i had that chip
[18:06] on my shoulder um and so you know i i so
[18:10] that was a win and you know made a
[18:11] little money there but definitely not
[18:13] you know didn't hit what i
[18:15] had uh thought i would be kind of yeah
[18:18] at that point
[18:19] but um but you know i i learned so many
[18:22] things over the last several years and
[18:24] if it was not one thing it was another
[18:26] right if it was like oh well you don't
[18:27] have enough traction or early days it
[18:30] was oh you don't have a technical
[18:32] founder on your team or co-founder go
[18:34] and get one you're you know outsourcing
[18:36] it to a rail shop is not going to work
[18:39] you know back when
[18:40] that was super popular yeah
[18:42] and so you know it kind of changed and
[18:44] you asked me a question like
[18:46] you sort of asked like what what advice
[18:48] would i give well i'm gonna say that uh
[18:52] my advice is first of all i haven't had
[18:54] a oh
[18:56] the win that i was looking for i've
[18:57] always ended up having to shut it down
[18:59] for one reason or the other but i can
[19:01] tell you that there's i you know there
[19:03] there are some things that i observed
[19:05] with the ones that have won
[19:07] and um
[19:09] and then
[19:10] and then there were certainly things
[19:12] that i think were obvious and i've had
[19:14] the pleasure of
[19:15] speaking to thousands of founders over
[19:17] the last decade
[19:18] and what i find is you know team
[19:22] number one team is incredibly important
[19:26] and
[19:27] uh and it's almost like the most
[19:30] important and you know and
[19:32] i know a lot of folks would maybe
[19:34] disagree with that but let me let me
[19:35] explain look i have tweeted the team is
[19:37] the company so i'm with you on this
[19:39] right yeah well well first of all it's
[19:42] like
[19:43] outside of the technical chops or you
[19:45] know business shops if you have the
[19:46] right team you can like hire for that
[19:48] right if you have the right team you can
[19:51] walk into a meeting
[19:53] with some investors and they'll invest
[19:56] and support you
[19:58] and if you have if you don't have the
[19:59] right team you're you're not even going
[20:01] to get to like step one to give yourself
[20:03] even
[20:04] even a chance to win and um and it ends
[20:07] up blowing up and those sort of things
[20:09] and so what does a a good team look like
[20:12] i think that a good team and this is a
[20:14] more esoteric sort of
[20:16] response a good team for me is going to
[20:19] be a team that can actually work
[20:21] together
[20:22] with as little ego as possible that are
[20:25] going to
[20:27] understand when they're wrong understand
[20:29] and and
[20:31] and
[20:32] accept when maybe there's some
[20:34] some weaknesses and i hate to say
[20:36] weaknesses but just you get my point um
[20:39] on you know within that team and then be
[20:42] able to proactively say hey list i'm not
[20:44] great at this uh we need to fill this
[20:47] gap you know those sort of things
[20:48] another one is taking care of yourself
[20:51] but i can't tell you how many fights
[20:52] over the last you know
[20:54] 16 17 years i had with co-founders um
[20:58] because of
[21:00] you know ego and the stress that's going
[21:02] on at that time yeah you know and unless
[21:05] you're like an elon musk who you can
[21:07] just spin up a bunch of [ __ ] you know
[21:09] all day and you know you're not gonna
[21:10] really uh go to zero and live in a car
[21:13] um
[21:14] and that's still stressful well if you
[21:16] if you take a step back with paypal i
[21:18] mean he got fired as ceo
[21:21] you know
[21:22] when he was out of the country like
[21:24] that's
[21:25] that's a starting point and then tesla
[21:27] he threw out like he was not a founder
[21:30] he invested in the series a
[21:31] he was on the cha was the chairman and
[21:33] then ended up throwing out the the
[21:36] founders of that so
[21:38] i don't i think that there is a natural
[21:41] struggle
[21:42] you know i respect
[21:46] that's why like my co-founder and i
[21:48] we've worked together we're best friends
[21:49] and best together like that relationship
[21:52] is super strong and that's actually one
[21:53] of the quantitative metric points for an
[21:55] angel investment
[21:57] is it has this this team worked together
[21:59] to have a long-term friendship because
[22:02] you have to draw deep on that
[22:05] just with all the
[22:06] man you know managing
[22:08] all the
[22:10] the anxiety the team like politics
[22:13] products bad news good news how do you
[22:15] manage it you know and
[22:17] and we're remote i haven't even seen
[22:18] chris
[22:20] any over a year
[22:21] since before we even launched
[22:24] so
[22:25] i'm excited to see you man you know i'm
[22:26] excited to see him but a lot of phone
[22:28] calls you know a lot of a lot of slack

[22:34] right now cool
[22:36] well paul we don't want to take up any
[22:38] more of your time and i say we uh i'm

## Full Text (No Timestamps)

[Music] thank you so much for joining us today i know that first of all i became aware of your company because heaton shaw was just going nuts and i've known peyton for many many years on twitter i used to be in the valley okay for most of my for most of my 30s i spent there and then i decided to come home to miami about two years ago pre-pandemic and then now it's a little crazy silicon valley with you you know what i don't know we'll see i you know it's there's a lot of stuff happening on twitter but uh we'll see if it actually happens like you know silicon valley has sustained the the test of time for a very long time for a lot of reasons and not just because of a couple vcs and stuff like that so we'll see listen i i would love there to be an uh a massive ecosystem that happens here that has half of the success that the valley has had but yeah we'll see i know that our world has changed quite a bit and so i think that it doesn't have to be silicon valley it could be you know what they're calling miami tech now or whatnot right but uh but yeah as long as there's you know it's fun and and we're supporting each other um that's what i care about but let's talk a little bit about yourself why don't you take a quick second to introduce yourself tell us a little bit about copy.ai and you know what what the hell did were you thinking to get on this journey yeah so i've been a founder am a venture capitalist for the past five years with my co-founder chris liu so we had helped employees exercise stock options at venture-backed companies and so we had seen hundreds of companies and had invested in hundreds of companies as well and he and i have been looking for the next big wave in tech and trying to figure out what the next frontier would be and when gpt2 launched in 2019 it was pretty clear to me that it would be increasingly powerful and that its creativity was off the charts so when gpt3 launched this past summer and we saw these amazing demos on twitter we knew that this is this could be it this could be the next big wave so we started building these little side projects and trying to figure out okay is there a market for this um and my hunch was that it was it was a good enough model that you could have a commercially viable product with it so the fourth mvp we launched was copy.ai we launched it on twitter we had 2 000 free signups the first two days of launch and those started to convert to paying customers and then pretty soon we knew that we'd have like a real startup to launch and so we quit our jobs and we transitioned out and started building this full-time and here we are about less than five months later we've had 60 000 a month in recurring revenue and uh we're making our our third higher this week so things are going well you know so and the product is very much product led right like you know i've signed up to it i'm probably going to start using it at our our new company um reprise and because i'm heading up content and stuff like that there you know when you think about that journey early on and you decided first of all we're going to go product led and we want this to be a self-serve for a variety of reasons what was kind of the the mindset when you decided we're going to do this thing self-serve at least you know have that tier go to market with that as opposed to we're going to build out something that's going to be a little more sales-led or human-led and maybe we're going to go up market and good you know out of the out of the box like start to get you know five figure deals and those sort of things yeah we didn't think about that at the time it was mostly like hey what what little thing can we build and test and when you do it that way and you have 2 000 signups i mean you're not thinking about going up market you're really thinking about oh i'll just add some stripe subscription integration and then i'm done that's obviously product led and then the question is is that going to be enough to sustain a company or do you just put the sales hat on and try to go to market that way and win one deal after the next and um yeah so for us we didn't have to even get to that point it just kind of worked um from from the bottoms up um with the product led growth which has been amazing because that's that's a great feature to have for a business model right yeah like it can it can scale as long as hard as you want so it's not dependent on us you know doing a lot of outreach and a lot of custom building really nice well i mean first of all that's that's the holy grail right if you can get that you know how many companies for so long have been trying to go product led you know even before this category which i think is probably about you know four years five years old i i would say is when i started to see the folks over at openview start to talk about it and vlog about it but you know people have been really trying to do it and i feel like it's it's really really difficult because it's so very close to a lot of the motions that you would have to go through uh within a like a consumer b2c app right but but b2b as well so i i think in one side it's like easier to be able to say okay well let's fix that problem within the uh enterprise or within an organization on the other side it's all right well how do we get it to like grow itself right were there any initial sort of tactics or strategies you use to to like you know set the set this on fire i mean 2000 sign ups right away is pretty good man well we yeah i mean i've been on twitter like not heavily but more heavily like increasingly heavy for like 18 months no maybe 12 months leading up to that so since we kept launching things each time we launch we get more followers and then i think at about 2 000 by the time i launched and then i asked everybody that i followed basically to retweet it or like it like hey watch this would appreciate your support and that helped propel it and then i think it got picked up in the twitter algorithm too because we got a little bit more reach with that one um so yeah that was like that's a that's a really great way to kick off a large product launch you know yeah so was it very much like hey our go to market is twitter and focused on twitter at least initial yeah the initial kickoff was that for sure and did you find that like hashtags uh those sort of things were were valuable or just really just driving engagement yeah engagement yeah yeah be it be interesting i mean that's it yeah well dude i i follow you and you know i've been following you for months now and i've just been seeing the mrr move up and that tweet alone is [ __ ] badass man yeah that's a good thing you look good yeah that one probably gets pretty pretty good engagement doesn't it it does i tried to stick some more some more content in it now so it's not just the mrr although occasionally i'll do it so today's was um you know 60k mrr and then like a space and then the next line said hired again number three builds in public on twitter the rocket ship like it's getting people excited we were literally recruiting from twitter so anyone that follows us should should be seeing this you know hey who wants to work on something cool like i'm literally on twitter hiring people that's amazing you know well look at what the city of miami mayor just did right like it's very similar right yeah and so so there's a little story there he's married to my cousin gloria and uh um like you know of course i hadn't seen gloria in 20 years because i've been in new york and the bay area for a while and uh and so like i pinged him when i got back and i was like hey you know i'm in tech or you know i forgot exactly what i said but i said you know i really would like to help the ecosystem here and get involved because he's always been like known to be forward thinking and then a week later this whole like can i help whatever tweet that went viral and i haven't been able to get in touch with him ever since but but it's so [ __ ] interesting it's like twitter is has it got there i mean i worked at twitter you know and we were still trying to figure it out early on um and this was nine years ago right right no okay so twitter yeah i yeah i've studied it i've studied it somewhere and then i've studied it some more and the thing is yes like everything in life is about finding a point of leverage and and basically extracting maximum leverage out of something and usually there's going to be one channel that works better than any other channel and you dominate it like you really go get all of it so for anyone like for mayor suarez like it's so easy it's like this brain dead obvious growth channel he can get you know keith your boys to town he he just got peter teal to town to at least live there they bring like their friends to at least buy a house whether or not they're there full-time they start tweeting about hey we're down here you know hey like keith's been having meetings like he said non-stop for six months nine nine am to nine pm every day face-to-face meetings you have this the tax base advantage and you have like uh the beach yeah so those are really great advantages and and they've been able to pick up you know some new work a lot of new york momentum but i'd say the big thing is tech and what the pandemics proved is that you can build a company anywhere you don't have to be in san francisco so if that's the case then you're not stuck in san francisco no one's stuck you can move and live with wherever you want and when that happens then it's not about access to talent and that that stuff it's lifestyle and culture and that's where i don't think silicon valley is really thinking that through like what kind of what kind of cultural you know art what kind of culture and like quality of life are we really offering and if the answer is not much or it's not very good or people don't feel like they're appreciated and it's in a place where they're generating almost all the wealth and the equity then that the talent's going to leave the talent's going to go somewhere where they want to be so they you know suarez picked up this beautiful momentum my my best performing tweet of all of last year was about miami it was in may i said just talk to a prominent angel ambassador who's moving to miami you know cited uh low lower taxes like beachfront real estate and like better fiber internet or something like that you know it got like over 2 000 likes and so this this was like hitting this central nervous point on twitter and the reason i posted it was because i i had three friends moved down there just from sf to there within a two week period and none of them even knew that the other person had gone there they basically just went and rented an airbnb so i was trying to figure out like all right these people are great angel investors angel investors are all about early stage traction all about it so they can sense signal and they can predict trends way before everyone else so i started looking at the ecosystem figure out hey who else is down there and there were some really incredible tech people really incredible so you had like the founder of yaks the founder of digitalocean the founder of chewie's alexis sohanian was there which i didn't realize yeah i didn't know either jervin pichavar is there like that's already a crew they just were not really that's not really a part of the tech ecosystem down there and like the accelerators and whatnot um so i saw like we've got potential i'm like this is this is exciting cause i was looking at creating a founder's house down there it was but it was just too hard to rent a place because i had i had founders that wanted to go and like just room together i was like we could just take that promote it and do all sorts of stuff and then it was just too hard to get any real estate rentals yeah so we i skipped that you know okay this is interesting though i'm not going to focus on that let me go build some gt3 apps nice good call on that well listen yeah very good call but if you do want any real estate i can hook you up with my real estate guy yes i've known him since we were uh grew up together we were about 11 years old wow so he manages my property when uh that's awesome and i'm not around but let's talk a little bit about that transition because there's so many like early stage entrepreneurs who are you know playing with products or side projects and they're seeing a little traction and often you know sometimes you jump off the cliff too early and there's a variety of different issues with stress and runway and those sort of things where if you jump off too early you can really just kill the business to you know right away but if you're just doing this zombie thing where you're like you know phoning it in at work during the day and then coming home you know working till 3 a.m you know that's not going to get it either when did you know it was the right time to quit a great job you know as a vc and double down uh when i bet when we validated just the traction metrics so we knew what the paid conversion rate was we knew how many organic signups we were getting per day at that point i knew it was venture backable and we had maybe you know total spent like 40 hours building it which is nuts right it's not much because gpt3 is doing the work so we this is not typical i'd say most founders have are in that scenario that you laid out and there are hundreds of of people and that's in that situation right now on twitter and um my my intuition is that the problem is not the product necessarily it's their distribution and then their understanding of how to monetize i think if that's where the weaknesses are for most most of those people and then the third one would be understanding what a 10x product looks like so if you just listen to your customers and users you can get incremental improvements but it's not going to give you that big big big result that's going to like set off a chain reaction which you really need to have a big amount of traction so because my my co-founder chris and i we were you know we're investors so i have my own quantitative angel investing metrics like literally just calculate these numbers and i was like we don't get a good score chris i was like we fall short in two key areas i said one traction but i mean traction i'm not quitting my job until i get traction with something that's meaningful so we knew that which which meant i didn't have to like labor over do i quit my job or not right so just mentally that was really refreshing because you could have fun you could launch stuff and not take it so seriously and not labor over all that stuff um the second one was um the second one was we haven't worked at startups ourselves we've invested in early stage companies so our weakness will be building and managing a team so that's like the the thing we're going through now now that we've left but we knew that coming in so we were we were more hesitant to like go hire a bunch of people and just because we thought that would blow us up like we would not be able to manage it yeah so well that resonates pretty deeply with me just because yeah i've been on the other side of the coin where you know like uh i've always been an operator or a founder you know and i've made a thousand mistakes you know i'm 40 years old this year and um congratulations man thank you thank you i made it yeah i'm 33. all right well dude like when i was 33 i was uh well not too long ago but i i was uh hacking on a startup of course in the valley broke uh yeah because actually you know what yeah was it no actually about 33 i was uh and we had sold the business to twitter so but i wasn't the founder i was the early early employees it was my one of my best friends companies and so you know he brought me in when they were like three founders i was the first hire and um i was always a really good first hire uh for non-technical stuff because at one point i was a nightclub promoter so i figured out how to do like promotions and yeah you know um and uh and events and then i was always a sales person i was a door-to-door sales person i had also started a couple software companies and and failed so you know i had that chip on my shoulder um and so you know i i so that was a win and you know made a little money there but definitely not you know didn't hit what i had uh thought i would be kind of yeah at that point but um but you know i i learned so many things over the last several years and if it was not one thing it was another right if it was like oh well you don't have enough traction or early days it was oh you don't have a technical founder on your team or co-founder go and get one you're you know outsourcing it to a rail shop is not going to work you know back when that was super popular yeah and so you know it kind of changed and you asked me a question like you sort of asked like what what advice would i give well i'm gonna say that uh my advice is first of all i haven't had a oh the win that i was looking for i've always ended up having to shut it down for

like the most important and you know and i know a lot of folks would maybe disagree with that but let me let me explain look i have tweeted the team is the company so i'm with you on this right yeah well well first of all it's like outside of the technical chops or you know business shops if you have the right team you can like hire for that right if you have the right team you can walk into a meeting with some investors and they'll invest and support you and if you have if you don't have the right team you're you're not even going to get to like step one to give yourself even even a chance to win and um and it ends up blowing up and those sort of things and so what does a a good team look like i think that a good team and this is a more esoteric sort of response a good team for me is going to be a team that can actually work together with as little ego as possible that are going to understand when they're wrong understand and and and accept when maybe there's some some weaknesses

all the the anxiety the team like politics products bad news good news how do you manage it you know and and we're remote i haven't even seen chris any over a year since before we even launched so i'm excited to see you man you know i'm excited to see him but a lot of phone calls you know a lot of a lot of slack messages and you're in tennessee right yeah that's awesome yeah he's in houston right now cool well paul we don't want to take up any more of your time and i say we uh i'm not sure maybe my co-host which is somewhere with my grandma having it hovering around here but uh but yeah like
