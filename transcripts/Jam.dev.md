[00:00] you hit the pandemic shut down I start
[00:02] just brainstorming ideas I found a site
[00:04] called brambucket.com which has a logo
[00:06] and a website domain name and it's for
[00:08] sale and so I started browsing that
[00:10] thing I went through all 80 000 logos on
[00:13] that site every single one so hey
[00:15] everybody you are on 100 Builders today
[00:18] we have Paul yakubian with us with the
[00:20] CEO of copy.ai copy.ai uses generative
[00:24] AI to help anyone right compelling
[00:26] marketing copy instantly and Paul you
[00:30] have an ambitious goal to enable a
[00:33] billion new entrepreneurs by 2030 by
[00:35] helping anyone create and sell new
[00:37] products and services online it's it's
[00:40] so awesome to have you here
[00:42] it's not going to take until 2030. it's
[00:44] not going to take until 20 30. I
[00:46] guarantee that
[00:48] uh it's gonna be a lot faster than 2030
[00:51] and um
[00:52] it'll just give you a little background
[00:54] about me I started out in the Middle
[00:57] School day trading stocks during the
[00:59] first tech bubble with my dad
[01:01] and we yeah they just come out of
[01:04] discount brokerages like online size
[01:05] where you can day trade and that was
[01:07] like really phenomenal so I could trade
[01:09] these like high-tech companies their
[01:11] IPOs it was an absurd time and whatever
[01:13] you bought made money so you feel like a
[01:15] genius and I'm like I'm only you know
[01:17] I'm only whatever 12. like this is easy
[01:19] money you know and so that's when I got
[01:23] addicted to technology they were talking
[01:24] about how valuable the internet was
[01:26] going to be and the Internet it's like
[01:28] oh wow all the information is going to
[01:29] be on there I can communicate with
[01:30] anyone in real time instantly for free I
[01:33] can find all this information out
[01:36] uh you know you'd have video like any
[01:38] kind of video archival footage music
[01:42] and you're just like this is insane like
[01:45] so much value is sitting in this big
[01:47] pool of resources and we're just
[01:49] continuing to add and add an add to it
[01:51] and so the question that I always had
[01:52] was this this internet thing is so big I
[01:55] can never consume all of it
[01:57] right so how do we actually access all
[01:59] the value that's in the internet
[02:01] to do things that are valuable for me
[02:03] or for you know my customer
[02:06] and so fast forward you had a stock
[02:09] crash I realized I didn't know anything
[02:11] about accounting or economics I went and
[02:13] did that in school became a CPA did the
[02:15] hedge fund thing did the Venture Capital
[02:17] thing and then I'll it did the Angel
[02:19] Investing thing and then I was like okay
[02:21] time to build and write like right as uh
[02:26] as deciding a bill it started like
[02:27] tweeting this is like late 2019 uh gpt2
[02:31] it just come out so I started using that
[02:33] like text generally what can you do with
[02:35] this thing first thing very clear it was
[02:39] just at the point where the words made
[02:41] sense and I'm like okay this is this
[02:44] this is not a small feat because
[02:46] everything that people do can be
[02:49] commanded with Words which means that if
[02:51] you can generate words you can command
[02:53] anything you want and you can and uh and
[02:57] furthermore was not about factual
[02:59] accuracy in the beginning it's more like
[03:02] pure creativity and so that was totally
[03:05] counter to the narrative like oh we'll
[03:07] never replace creative jobs and it's you
[03:09] know I'm gonna do these factual things
[03:11] and I'm like this is absurd if you just
[03:14] use the thing right and so I was like
[03:17] okay how long
[03:19] you know nobody's ever good at
[03:20] predicting timelines I'm like how long
[03:22] is going to take before this is
[03:23] commercially viable where you could
[03:25] actually sell the words coming out of
[03:26] these these models
[03:28] and I you know I just make up a number
[03:30] five seven here or something like that
[03:31] right it's like oh it's gonna be seven
[03:33] years away so I started like just
[03:34] brainstorming like crazy uh ended up you
[03:38] know you hit the pandemic shut down I
[03:40] start just brainstorming ideas on in the
[03:42] PowerPoint deck I ended up with 170
[03:45] ideas
[03:46] you know I was trying to figure out what
[03:48] are the triggers to all these ideas
[03:49] because you have ideas in your head like
[03:52] oh look that's a startup idea and then
[03:54] you forget it and it gets lost forever
[03:56] right and at some point like something
[03:58] triggers that idea to flood back into
[04:00] your brain you're like oh I forgot about
[04:02] that idea so I started writing it down
[04:04] and I started to try to find these tips
[04:05] and hacks to come out with more ideas
[04:07] and I find this I found a site called
[04:09] brambucket.com which has a logo and a
[04:12] website domain name and it's for sale
[04:14] and that would trigger ideas in my head
[04:17] just looking at the name this like
[04:18] domain name
[04:20] and so I started browsing that thing I
[04:22] went through all 80 000 logos on that
[04:25] site every single one
[04:29] I was like oh this is easy like I bet at
[04:32] some point you could just like feed this
[04:34] as an input and like an AI model could
[04:36] give you like 10 startup ideas off that
[04:39] thing right which you can do now
[04:41] well Paul all what all these ideas
[04:43] around like gp22 or like what do you
[04:46] what is just like all over the place
[04:48] just random stuff yeah just random stuff
[04:51] like you know I I was deconstructing
[04:55] just
[04:57] I mean it's random stuff like it's in
[04:59] your head most the ideas are stupid and
[05:01] dumb and I think those are probably the
[05:03] best ideas and those are the ones that
[05:05] get panned the hardest by your friends
[05:07] like your friends will laugh at it and
[05:08] then say that's really stupid that is
[05:11] the side of an amazing idea
[05:13] so the first one I put on there was
[05:15] called
[05:16] I made up this domain name as
[05:17] hugedance.com
[05:19] and the idea was you can't buy a dam in
[05:24] one click
[05:25] right so there's no e-commerce for like
[05:29] multi-billion dollar infrastructure of
[05:31] projects
[05:32] we're like damn like you know like the
[05:34] thing that like stops water from going
[05:36] like the Hoover Dam man yeah if you need
[05:40] a damn where are you gonna go get it
[05:41] right you can't just buy it now right so
[05:43] the whole idea behind that was
[05:46] like if you look at the search like SEO
[05:48] started falling like there's almost no
[05:51] no uh searches for that but like that
[05:53] one search you know like if you show up
[05:55] on that one search and you land the deal
[05:58] that's like a hundred million dollar
[05:59] referral fee right so these are like
[06:02] little baby call options and you can
[06:04] just set that thing up forever if you
[06:06] sell the damn you're done like you're
[06:08] good
[06:09] you know what I mean
[06:10] and that's something that's very very uh
[06:13] simple and uh the other thing I realized
[06:16] was
[06:17] like how do you how do you shrink the
[06:19] amount of MVP required to actually test
[06:22] some idea
[06:24] so I was a couple weeks ago
[06:27] at a Fourth of July party at friends
[06:29] house they've got like the whiskey
[06:31] Advocate magazine sitting on the table
[06:33] I'm like there should be one for rib
[06:34] eyes because I I eat ribeye right I just
[06:37] had a rib eye like where's the one for
[06:39] rib eyes so I'm like all right I'm gonna
[06:41] create like a ribeye magazine right so
[06:43] then the first thing I do in my brain is
[06:44] like let me get the domain names what
[06:46] are we talking about here right because
[06:47] that like sets the vision of the name
[06:50] and the whatever the brand so I got I
[06:53] ended up picking up ribeyemagazine.com
[06:55] uh ribeye advocate.com
[06:58] steakspectator.com so I got like three
[07:00] domains it's like 20 bucks right
[07:03] and then I'm like
[07:06] I don't like in my head I've got like
[07:08] the old I don't have like the best
[07:10] scoping mechanism naturally so I'm like
[07:13] oh I need like a physical I want a
[07:15] physical print magazine right and then
[07:17] I'm like that's so much effort to even
[07:19] try that out and so I built I build a
[07:22] lot of um AI prompts like all day long
[07:24] in our chat tool and then in our like
[07:26] conversational UI chats system prompts
[07:29] workflow automation so like
[07:32] the next thing I'm like
[07:33] can I just give this computer this idea
[07:36] and then have it give me like easy ideas
[07:38] it spits out like this MVP generator I
[07:41] throw the idea and it's like
[07:44] create like a Facebook group I'm like of
[07:46] course it's like just a Facebook group
[07:48] you know it's like created created
[07:51] Twitter handle it reads tweets about
[07:54] real eyes and I'm like Bingo that's it
[07:56] so like six minutes later I have like at
[08:00] ribeye magazine all I do is like I have
[08:02] one uh search term keyword which is like
[08:06] ribeye mentions minimum faves 100. I
[08:10] just run it every week and I retweet all
[08:11] the good stuff right and I'm like I'm
[08:14] ready to go
[08:16] if you look at that feed it's sick it's
[08:19] awesome it's like exactly what people
[08:22] you know in a very Niche demographic
[08:26] so Paul were you doing this were you
[08:29] doing this like when like the pandemic
[08:31] hit like you're just like at home
[08:33] retweeting rubai we need to have GPT
[08:36] we'd have we didn't have a chat like
[08:39] turbo models we didn't have a gpt4 so
[08:42] gbt3 was a little bit harder to do you
[08:45] had to give it examples in order for it
[08:46] to pattern match and so that was like
[08:49] that's just a pain in the butt but now
[08:50] you can just describe what you want boom
[08:52] it's done so I think that that is
[08:54] totally different I tried um one of the
[08:57] 170 ideas was
[08:59] um
[09:00] this is like a pain point
[09:02] uh if any of you all have had like
[09:05] family members move different countries
[09:08] like my dad came to the U.S he brought
[09:10] his family with him after he had settled
[09:12] here
[09:13] that moving is really hard and one of
[09:16] the one of the themes about moving is I
[09:18] don't want to just be the only person
[09:20] that moves I want to move like my whole
[09:22] crew with me
[09:24] and so then I was like oh man this is
[09:25] easy right it was like a software
[09:27] platform you sign up you invite all your
[09:29] family and friends and then this thing
[09:31] coordinates the entire move of like
[09:34] 100
[09:36] 000 people whatever it is
[09:37] and I realized like even in that idea
[09:40] when you take it to the Limit you're
[09:41] like how would Elon Musk like describe
[09:43] the mission it's like you were you were
[09:45] providing like Geographic freedom to
[09:48] large numbers of people all at once and
[09:51] so now imagine if you had you built that
[09:53] up and said okay what are where are we
[09:55] going what kind of place do we want to
[09:57] live in or what kind of city do we want
[09:59] to live in you could from scratch if you
[10:01] had the wait list of like 100 000 people
[10:04] ready to move you could build a new city
[10:05] it's silly
[10:07] right and then and then what I realized
[10:10] is he could apply that same thing like
[10:11] he could he could do this all over the
[10:13] place one of the things I want to do is
[10:15] like asteroid mining right just sell
[10:18] real estate on the ashtray to people now
[10:20] and then use the cash to fund the
[10:21] mission right this is like old school
[10:25] stuff this should be happening right now
[10:26] but there are so many things that I want
[10:29] to build and I'm like I there's not the
[10:31] infrastructure the platform for me to
[10:34] put the idea into it and then to set the
[10:36] idea in motion to make it happen
[10:38] so right now like at most a person can
[10:41] focus on one thing one core activity at
[10:44] a time
[10:45] one startup idea and then you're like if
[10:48] I do that it's like I'm I'm leaving all
[10:50] my other you know children out in the
[10:52] rain and I'm just like it's so sad right
[10:54] it's like
[10:56] that's not the future the future is that
[10:58] all the software and just lets the
[11:01] computers like handle all the details
[11:03] and then you're just going and pushing
[11:05] the mission of the things that you care
[11:07] about forward
[11:09] so when I look on Twitter none of that's
[11:12] happening anywhere like the only person
[11:14] that was really doing that was Elon
[11:17] and now he's like all in about Twitter
[11:19] and the politics of things like that is
[11:22] a
[11:23] that's a kind of like um
[11:25] it's like the death of your futuristic
[11:28] Vision Visionary right it's like we we
[11:31] we're trying to be futuristic and
[11:33] Visionary and moving things forward
[11:34] making progress and then the leader of
[11:37] that
[11:38] got bogged down right on a on an
[11:41] important Mission but one that does not
[11:43] bring you know it breaks negative people
[11:46] together
[11:47] um even like the I don't know is is
[11:50] Twitter Dart mode for you guys now on
[11:51] desktop now
[11:54] even things like that like light mode is
[11:57] great when I'm in dark mode I'm gonna
[11:58] complain about everything
[12:00] you know
[12:02] oh why why is that
[12:04] all they do first of all all the news is
[12:06] all the news right now is terrible like
[12:09] all international news domestic news
[12:11] political news
[12:13] a lot of economic news except for the
[12:15] actual facts that the economy is growing
[12:16] at two and a half percent which no one
[12:18] wants to bleed so I don't know I really
[12:20] think we have like a very
[12:22] we're just everybody's very divorced
[12:24] from reality right now if you're online
[12:26] which is not good because most people
[12:29] are online
[12:31] um
[12:31] so yeah anyway so I think I'm gonna have
[12:33] to like we're gonna opt out of the
[12:36] present day conversations that I think
[12:39] we do that as being like builders
[12:42] but then anyone building like we have to
[12:45] be way more vocal about
[12:47] what like the aspirational things that
[12:49] we're trying to like achieve and what
[12:51] we're trying to get to not company
[12:53] specific but just like what are the
[12:55] things that you know what are things
[12:57] we're passionate about what are the
[12:58] things we want accomplished for example
[12:59] one of those ideas I had was called uh
[13:03] it's like civilization in a box
[13:06] right so imagine you got a house in the
[13:09] suburbs like me I want to park a unit on
[13:12] there and I want to disconnect my house
[13:13] from the entire
[13:15] and I want to run it off the box so
[13:18] what's in the box
[13:20] if you got like a star link on there
[13:22] right you got some wastewater treatment
[13:24] thing in there you got some water
[13:25] reserves
[13:27] you've got a
[13:29] what I'll say battery backup solar like
[13:34] composting toilet all of that stuff can
[13:36] fit on a unit and the unit cost is like
[13:39] under 20 grand
[13:41] so this week I have not had water
[13:44] because we had a power outage
[13:46] our power was out for three days
[13:49] they put a they put a diesel generator
[13:52] right above the water reservoir in our
[13:54] suburb the diesel generator Elite Diesel
[13:58] into the water
[13:59] and so we're going to turn your water on
[14:01] it smells like diesel
[14:03] and they're like you can't drink the
[14:04] water this for six days
[14:07] and I'm like I I have lost civilization
[14:10] like it's way too centralized right now
[14:13] and we're just not taking care of it so
[14:15] we need to really rip it out so when I
[14:17] was thinking about civilization in a box
[14:19] my brain's gone well when you could you
[14:21] could rent your box out like if there's
[14:23] a hurricane it hits the Gulf Coast and
[14:24] people without power I could rent my box
[14:26] out and make the money back that that
[14:28] pays me for the thing that I had right
[14:30] and so just these little things would
[14:33] really
[14:34] it's like one after the next I'm like I
[14:35] need to do that I need to do that and
[14:37] then Dolly came out because I was like
[14:39] what the hell is this box gonna look
[14:41] like right nobody's gonna like buy a
[14:44] freaking uh Intermodal container right
[14:46] who wants to part you can't even park it
[14:49] with all the restrictions
[14:51] so with Dolly I like I literally just
[14:53] describe what's on the thing
[14:57] and it generated all these beautiful
[14:59] pictures of it I don't see if I can find
[15:01] some
[15:03] and once once I I'm gonna show it to you
[15:07] uh once I saw it I was like okay like
[15:11] just the visioning of it like physical
[15:13] stuff just visioning that product
[15:16] made it come absolutely to life and
[15:19] what's awesome is it's like
[15:21] you could do Infinity variations of it
[15:24] look at that oh wow that looks pretty
[15:26] cool
[15:28] that's not it this one
[15:30] so this was like an I I was like what if
[15:32] Apple made like a full body mass this is
[15:35] during covet I generate that I'm like
[15:37] that's awesome I'm like we could all
[15:40] still go out we could see each other's
[15:42] faces it'd be awesome I'm like you'd
[15:45] have like a container you could control
[15:47] your like oxygen levels you could pipe
[15:50] other things into this thing you could
[15:52] have ambient music in there right you
[15:54] could if it's too loud you could just
[15:56] tune it down I'm like this whole thing
[15:58] there's like an apple based environment
[16:02] um and I was like yeah I need I need to
[16:04] build that too then you get into like
[16:06] really
[16:08] more industrial type
[16:11] stuff
[16:13] you know but you can really look at that
[16:14] that's like a freaking throat you put
[16:17] that in your pitch deck you know what I
[16:19] mean that's something that rivian would
[16:21] build everybody well Tesla needs to
[16:23] build this for sure because they they
[16:25] could put one in every house
[16:28] um so those are things I'm like man all
[16:31] this stuff's gonna exist on some kind of
[16:33] timeline
[16:34] but I'm only one human
[16:36] right how do we how do
[16:40] well in the business part's in the way
[16:42] the entire like here's the idea we have
[16:45] a vision of it right we need to name it
[16:47] we need a website we need a landing page
[16:49] we need a pre-order form we need like a
[16:51] stripe account we need a uh you know
[16:54] incorporation I need to figure out which
[16:57] people on planet Earth
[16:59] care about this Mission and would want
[17:01] to join the company and I need to get
[17:03] them on board
[17:04] and then I need to get like
[17:06] I mean it's probably gonna be made
[17:07] overseas right but like
[17:09] I need to get the costs of doing it
[17:12] overseas I need to get the cost of it
[17:13] doing in the US I need a prod project
[17:15] manager and then I need a way to fulfill
[17:17] all this stuff
[17:20] I don't know like I've seen Elon do that
[17:22] with his team but like I don't know how
[17:25] to do any of that stuff and so it
[17:27] probably just comes down
[17:29] this is where you have like the unknown
[17:31] right where you're like what would we do
[17:34] first what's the most important thing to
[17:36] do first probably slap a landing page up
[17:39] tweet it out with a wait list
[17:42] put some price tag on there like
[17:44] probably just back of the envelope calc
[17:46] about how much it would cost put a price
[17:48] tag on there get the waitlist up you got
[17:51] the wait list
[17:52] now it's like hand to hand combat with
[17:54] the seed investors right maybe you have
[17:57] a prototype and you're just showing demo
[17:59] videos all day long of you building it
[18:02] like that would also work
[18:04] um and I think you get this whole thing
[18:05] off the ground and like
[18:08] I don't know like six weeks with like 10
[18:10] grand you know and and think about the
[18:13] numbers if you price it up
[18:15] a hundred grand and you've got
[18:19] like a thousand
[18:20] orders
[18:22] how much is that in sales
[18:25] it's like a hundred million dollars
[18:29] right it's sick
[18:31] okay
[18:33] so if you got one order per one million
[18:36] impressions on Twitter then you just
[18:37] need Auto million impressions
[18:39] then you just need like Elon to say haha
[18:41] or something like that and then retweet
[18:44] it right and then you got like that six
[18:45] million impressions you've got six
[18:47] orders
[18:48] so it doesn't take that long but that
[18:51] thing needs to be very beautiful and the
[18:53] thing I've noticed about uh
[18:55] it's specifically like consumer products
[18:57] you've got Apple they just hire all the
[19:00] designers there are no designers left
[19:02] for anyone else they have hired them all
[19:06] right
[19:07] they they freaking hired all of them and
[19:10] they have like three products
[19:12] I'm like why are you doing this to every
[19:14] like you're doing this to
[19:16] Humanity
[19:17] so that's kind of disappointing
[19:20] you know what I mean
[19:22] they have like 10 000 designers at that
[19:25] company
[19:26] and three products
[19:31] so and the iPhone design doesn't really
[19:34] change so like where what are what are
[19:36] they doing
[19:38] and why are they not working for other
[19:40] you know people with more innovative
[19:42] ideas
[19:43] I don't know
[19:45] so
[19:46] so you're sitting there it's the
[19:48] beginning of the pandemic you're having
[19:49] Dolly generate your boxes you're like
[19:52] resisting the urge to sell Downs no no
[19:56] no that was the next year so 2020 you
[19:59] wouldn't have dolly
[20:00] you didn't have uh anything until Dali
[20:04] that first blog post they didn't release
[20:06] anything but they showed like the
[20:07] avocado backpack I think that was I
[20:09] don't know if that was January is that
[20:11] what's behind you
[20:13] yeah I made it I got it made
[20:16] this backpack costs 200 bucks fully
[20:18] custom
[20:20] and I got it in under a month
[20:22] from the date of generating the idea
[20:26] to do this do you know what you have to
[20:27] do I didn't know how to get a backpack
[20:29] all right go on upwork
[20:32] you find a buyer
[20:34] agent
[20:36] who can get things made overseas
[20:39] all right I found one lady she's
[20:41] incredible
[20:42] she's incredible most Buyer Agents are
[20:44] not great I I've interviewed and brought
[20:47] in four I built a little air table to
[20:49] track these projects I had a few things
[20:51] made
[20:52] and then they go on like AliExpress
[20:55] and there's like the like
[20:58] Chinese the Chinese manufacturer all
[21:01] they do is backpacks they do like
[21:02] probably a billion or a trillion
[21:04] backpacks a year they will do custom
[21:06] one-offs for like 100 bucks and then the
[21:09] shipping's like 60.
[21:11] so to make a product fantastic all comes
[21:15] down to
[21:16] the the like
[21:18] the design details which Dolly didn't
[21:20] have I had like the front
[21:22] version of the bag and they're like all
[21:24] right what what's the inside look like
[21:25] I'm like
[21:27] then I go to the back look like I'm like
[21:29] I don't know you know so she helped me
[21:32] really like pick the materials out she
[21:34] really loved the project and then when
[21:36] they built the backpack
[21:38] they even sent me this like full-on
[21:40] product Showcase Video they were so
[21:43] happy that they got to build something
[21:45] like that
[21:46] and there was so much pride in it and
[21:49] people were like oh it's like an AI
[21:50] generated backpack it's like no actually
[21:52] I described what I wanted I curated the
[21:55] one I wanted
[21:56] someone helped me find someone to make
[21:58] it the people made it they picked the
[22:01] materials out like these are very human
[22:03] oriented process right now
[22:05] and
[22:06] that outfit's great so like I use you
[22:08] know that's my bag uh I take it
[22:11] everywhere I get a lot of yeah a lot of
[22:12] compliments on it but it's also like it
[22:14] actually gets the job done I got other
[22:16] things made that were crap
[22:18] like I would not would not recommend
[22:20] this
[22:21] uh I had like it was like a track suit
[22:25] you know and I'm like sending them like
[22:27] all these like futuristic Blade Runner
[22:29] style like tracksuit designs and ideas
[22:31] and then I get it and it's like just
[22:33] it'd be like an eight dollar like
[22:36] Walmart like warm-up thing with terrible
[22:39] colors and I was like this is not what I
[22:41] wanted yeah they're like oh okay we
[22:44] understand what you want like that would
[22:45] be sixteen hundred dollars and I'm like
[22:46] I'm not doing that so then I know
[22:50] it could everything can be made but it's
[22:52] just a matter of the one are you working
[22:54] at the right people to do it
[22:56] and then two like are you okay with
[22:58] whatever the cost is
[23:00] but it was that was a that was pretty
[23:03] fun
[23:04] my um I showed this dolly to my kids my
[23:08] four-year-old she was like I want a
[23:10] chicken hat it generated that I'm like
[23:12] that's that's amazing
[23:15] um they wanted to do if I had if I had a
[23:18] little bit of extra time I would
[23:20] actually build the toilet car that she
[23:22] described
[23:25] like an operational
[23:28] functioning toilet on
[23:31] a car
[23:33] I wish I had that in Bangladesh when I
[23:34] was growing up
[23:35] you know
[23:38] I mean if I tweet a video of that thing
[23:42] working it's gonna get all the views
[23:44] like it would go
[23:46] Infinity viral it would be like 10 10
[23:49] grand to build it
[23:52] I just don't have enough time
[23:56] um
[23:58] there was so many ideas how did you why
[24:00] did you decide to work on copy
[24:03] um
[24:04] I'll get to that in a second
[24:07] okay
[24:08] here's here's the other one here are
[24:11] three more boxes now
[24:14] like all right the other one's like
[24:16] Cloud cities floating cities like how do
[24:18] we make floating cities happen right I'm
[24:19] like I don't know like hot air
[24:21] like two hot air balloons with like a
[24:23] zip line in between it you can zipline
[24:25] like yes okay we have to do that as
[24:27] people right and somebody's like oh
[24:30] there there is this like vacuum system
[24:32] that that's been theorized as possible
[24:34] it could have like a vacuum balloon and
[24:36] that could pull stuff and I'm like what
[24:37] would that look like and then I try to
[24:39] describe it as as however I can and then
[24:42] Dolly's like oh like that and I'm like
[24:45] that is incredible
[24:48] I don't think
[24:50] my mind was so fun with Dolly it was
[24:53] like I'm just feeding it more things I
[24:55] like in the end of the input prompt and
[24:58] then my mind was just getting blunt I
[25:00] was up
[25:01] I don't I go to bed pretty like I go to
[25:03] bed around 10 10 30. I was up till like
[25:05] 3 A.M just like let me see this next set
[25:08] let me see this next item it was it was
[25:11] way too much once the models got
[25:13] realistic I lost interest
[25:16] because
[25:18] by definition there's nothing new
[25:21] about the realism and then when it's too
[25:23] real it doesn't give your mind like an
[25:25] an area to create around right because
[25:28] it's already filled in all the gaps
[25:30] and detail site I do think like that
[25:33] first uh the jankier the image generator
[25:36] the more fun it is
[25:38] and
[25:39] and it it kind of operates in a um
[25:43] it's kind of counterintuitive but you
[25:45] really want the the model to be going
[25:47] and doing
[25:50] expanding your mind right that's where I
[25:52] find the most value in in the imagen
[25:54] side
[25:56] um but now it's like hyper realistic you
[25:58] can see The Sweat Beads you know on the
[26:00] forehead and I'm like who cares like why
[26:03] why are we doing this I I have I have an
[26:05] unimportant question
[26:07] um when you were prompting Dolly here
[26:08] are you like
[26:10] two hot air balloons with a zip line or
[26:13] are you like two hot air balloons and a
[26:15] zip line in the style of blank 4K yeah
[26:18] what what's your what's the prop magic
[26:21] for
[26:22] I stopped doing Imaging because I'm like
[26:24] I'm either gonna I'm gonna go down some
[26:26] kind of round
[26:28] so I had to like wean myself off that
[26:30] tool
[26:31] uh at that time I liked Sid Mead he was
[26:33] the illustrator of The Blade Runner
[26:36] series and when you use in the style
[26:38] said me it puts everything into like
[26:40] this futuristic Escape which I think is
[26:43] really nice and then he could pair that
[26:45] with um shapes that I like like these
[26:49] bucky ball
[26:50] shapes which is like the you know Epcot
[26:53] type uh
[26:55] things and then when you put those two
[26:57] together
[26:59] usually it's like I want to see the
[27:02] thing in some kind of landscape either
[27:04] like floating over like San Francisco a
[27:08] city or something like that I don't even
[27:09] live in San Francisco but over a city uh
[27:12] or like in a Suburban like driveway
[27:15] which should sit like in my neck of the
[27:17] woods right so those are the things like
[27:20] it makes it more real but and and that
[27:22] is the idea with the visuals is like how
[27:24] do you how do you create
[27:27] yeah how do you envision Advanced
[27:29] Technologies that are so accessible
[27:32] because of where you put them in in the
[27:35] landscape that it makes it more real and
[27:37] then it increases in your brain
[27:39] the likelihood that you can build it
[27:42] because if you think you can't build it
[27:43] or it's too complicated you are not you
[27:46] could just move on to a different idea
[27:48] because that that's not going to take
[27:49] you anywhere
[27:51] um and so now I've got like this
[27:54] um insane backlog of stuff that used to
[27:56] get about and then I was like
[27:59] man all these
[28:01] once we did that I took the 180 ideas
[28:04] and categorized them by theme
[28:06] and there was a whole like there were
[28:08] six theme categories I don't remember
[28:10] the name of it uh all of them
[28:13] because I don't want to if I dust off
[28:15] that list I get very tempted to go build
[28:18] that stuff
[28:19] but the first the core category like
[28:21] what's the enabling category it was all
[28:23] around business processes and scaling
[28:26] the best business processes
[28:28] and learning from world-class things and
[28:31] applying that directly into the flow of
[28:33] how a business gets set up grows
[28:36] because I was like man the bottleneck
[28:38] isn't the ideation I have I have plenty
[28:41] of ideas the bottleneck is how do we get
[28:42] anything done how do we actually take an
[28:44] idea get it to Market and get it to the
[28:47] point where it can it can uh run on its
[28:49] own
[28:50] and um elon's done a great job of that
[28:53] like he's got a car company kind of
[28:56] running on its own he's got SpaceX kind
[28:58] of running on its own
[29:00] you know I think that's
[29:02] that's pretty absurd but that's the
[29:04] approach he's taken so in my head I'm
[29:06] like well any of these like SAS SAS
[29:09] companies should be the easiest
[29:11] to go full auto with
[29:15] um and then because you already not only
[29:17] do you have like everything is scoped
[29:19] and defined in code which is all text
[29:21] anyway but like even the best practices
[29:24] we know who the people are that have the
[29:26] best advice the best insights right we
[29:28] know them by name we know they're doing
[29:31] everything about them so you can start
[29:32] with like hey let's take the YC advice
[29:35] put that into a prompt and then ask it
[29:36] what it would do and it's like oh here
[29:38] great ideas you can take uh
[29:41] you should take like reforge content put
[29:44] it in a prompt and you can see what it
[29:45] will it would do or recommend
[29:48] um and so I think there there will be
[29:50] there is a lag right now between
[29:54] that capability and and professionals
[29:57] understanding of how to access it this
[30:00] is like an onboarding problem it's a
[30:02] generative AI
[30:03] and then um
[30:05] beyond that it's more like okay how do
[30:07] we actually deploy these insights a
[30:09] little bit you know with less friction
[30:11] in the companies
[30:13] so those are the problems that I'm I'm
[30:14] trying to solve now and then if once you
[30:17] unblock that it's game over because
[30:20] every single idea has a straight path
[30:23] towards validating every step that needs
[30:25] to get validated the MVP generator is
[30:28] scoping everything down into something
[30:30] that's very like possible to do within
[30:33] an hour or right now
[30:35] and then most of that stuff is being
[30:37] tailored because a lot of it's messaging
[30:40] right I need to find people I need to
[30:42] find vendors
[30:44] um
[30:45] I need to build like like a simple road
[30:48] map for a deck all that stuff is like
[30:50] easy to replicate now and with
[30:53] generative Ai and so
[30:55] that is uh those are increasingly solved
[30:58] problems now you stack them up in a row
[30:59] and you actually have a full-on business
[31:03] generation system which is the whole
[31:06] point and so once you build that once we
[31:09] build that out and that's what we're
[31:10] building
[31:11] uh marketing is so key to that like how
[31:14] do you structure the right landing page
[31:16] what are the benefits what are the pain
[31:18] points who are your customers what's the
[31:19] audience where do I find them who are
[31:21] they on LinkedIn how do we message them
[31:23] like those are the those are the
[31:25] blockers for everybody
[31:27] and so once you unblock that stuff
[31:31] now you can unleash all this creativity
[31:34] and that's what the models really Thrive
[31:37] at they Thrive at creativity because
[31:40] they want
[31:41] or they're probabilistic by Nature they
[31:43] Crank That temperature up give it some
[31:46] uh I got a prompt it's like my based
[31:48] prompt it's like hey be more bass be
[31:50] orthogonal like surprise me like all
[31:52] this stuff and it's like oh it throws
[31:55] you all these ideas right that are not
[31:56] average it's not just regurgitating like
[31:59] middle of the road stuff which most
[32:01] people find boring including myself
[32:04] uh yesterday I was like I was
[32:06] terminating uh something I was like hey
[32:07] we don't have customer success like
[32:09] generate like a customer success program
[32:11] and it did it the very basic one and I
[32:14] was like
[32:15] try again but do things that don't
[32:17] escape
[32:19] wow it sounds like here's like a like
[32:22] use this approach the Y combinator
[32:24] recommends right when you're finding
[32:26] private Market fit boom everything came
[32:28] out perfect I'm like that's what I want
[32:30] right I want to meet these people in
[32:32] person I want to do manual onboarding I
[32:35] want to send them swag all that stuff
[32:36] came out in that list but in that first
[32:38] list it was very boring and basic stuff
[32:41] so even things like that like how do you
[32:43] go from a
[32:44] now in my head everything's related
[32:46] right you have that initial prompt you
[32:48] can ask the model and say hey what's a
[32:51] better prompt
[32:52] right what's the one like what's a
[32:54] different way of structuring the problem
[32:56] everything it turns out is just
[32:58] variations
[32:59] and it's just variations on variations
[33:01] in brainstorming lists
[33:04] so that to me is like is golden and I'm
[33:07] like
[33:08] again there's so much stuff to build I'm
[33:11] like how are we gonna just
[33:15] we how do we figure out
[33:17] how to onboard more people in the into
[33:20] these types of platforms like ours
[33:23] where they can become ins like orders of
[33:26] magnitude more productive not just like
[33:28] hey I need help writing an email like
[33:31] one email that's not
[33:33] that's not transformational but it's an
[33:35] amazing first step for a lot of people
[33:36] because you can immediately see the
[33:37] value in it the time to the aha moment
[33:40] is like three seconds
[33:41] so even when you look at like uh all
[33:44] these like session link stats I don't
[33:46] know if y'all saw the character AI it's
[33:48] got like 30 minute sessions
[33:51] uh like gpt's guy like eight minute
[33:54] sessions I'm like
[33:55] they're like it's not you know it's fall
[33:58] like it's falling or whatever like the
[34:00] whole point is that the session's short
[34:02] right but every every product's designed
[34:05] to be to read right and get people to
[34:08] use it more
[34:09] so that begs the question what is the
[34:11] goal if if we're trying to get people to
[34:14] use this stuff more what what is the
[34:16] goal that we need to be promising people
[34:18] to say okay if you use our product more
[34:20] you're going to get more of what
[34:22] right so right now it's like we're gonna
[34:24] save you time okay well then you know
[34:27] why use the product you know at all when
[34:30] I just put it into an automation
[34:33] so that really is step one you do need
[34:35] to automate a lot of this stuff but you
[34:38] don't want to lose that creativity at
[34:39] the same time
[34:40] so you have to master
[34:42] the the Dark Art of prompt engineering
[34:45] and not not necessarily just tying these
[34:48] systems together but actually how do you
[34:50] get the best uh how do you get the
[34:53] models to act like
[34:54] actually capable
[34:57] people
[34:59] so that's what's up and then um
[35:02] now now we're moving in when you move
[35:04] into onboarding onboarding is the
[35:06] product like you guys have heard this
[35:07] before like
[35:10] if I like we built a system it's so
[35:12] powerful
[35:14] everybody like gpt4 insanely powerful
[35:16] you look at how people use it how are
[35:18] these in it
[35:21] they're not like people aren't even
[35:22] using it right
[35:24] wait are you serious
[35:27] most people are not using gpt4 for
[35:32] everything
[35:33] all day long
[35:35] right
[35:36] what is the onboarding
[35:39] what's the user onboarding for for gbt4
[35:43] um oh you have to confirm that you
[35:45] understand that this is experimental and
[35:47] then it yeah there is none this isn't
[35:50] the same right
[35:52] so you're everyone's having to discover
[35:54] how to even use it and then that needs
[35:56] to get translated back into some kind of
[35:57] onboarding to teach people how to use
[35:59] and and that onboard needs to be
[36:01] personalized and make it so that it's
[36:03] actually relevant useful for
[36:05] them so we're in that process like okay
[36:07] we if we we really just need to help
[36:09] people figure out what they can do with
[36:10] it and how it's relevant to them so all
[36:13] of the things that
[36:15] this is where they do things that don't
[36:17] scale is like
[36:19] it is the best approach because
[36:21] everything now we're doing
[36:23] manually one-to-one onboarding asking
[36:26] questions Discovery all that stuff can
[36:27] be replicated now in in a product inside
[36:31] the product inside of an onboarding
[36:34] but you have to build it and then you
[36:36] have to improve it it need a system that
[36:38] does that and so that's where you get
[36:40] into engineering
[36:41] um so that's what we're currently
[36:43] working on is improving all of that
[36:46] but I'd say that the the vision that
[36:49] most companies have like oh AI
[36:51] transformation like where are we gonna
[36:52] go they can they can already Envision
[36:55] that they they'd actually that's not a
[36:57] problem in terms of visioning it they
[37:00] just they need help getting there
[37:01] and so
[37:03] guess what's really good at taking a
[37:05] vision
[37:06] in a current state and breaking it down
[37:08] into series of steps
[37:10] yeah it's pretty good
[37:12] and it's pretty good at that right so
[37:15] it's like AI all the way down
[37:18] um
[37:19] so the next yeah I think people were
[37:22] like well what's
[37:24] I think there is some disappointment
[37:26] probably around like
[37:28] there's a lot of AI hype there's you
[37:31] know maybe things were oversold one of
[37:34] the things we've you know noticed
[37:35] immediately was Enterprise use cases
[37:39] are tricky like there are a lot of
[37:41] details you got to get right to get it
[37:43] to that level right
[37:45] so with gpt4 is like that you know we
[37:48] thought we knew three wasn't going to
[37:49] get there we need three and a half it's
[37:51] not quite good enough but four is
[37:53] actually good enough
[37:54] to
[37:56] follow enough instructions well enough
[37:58] to actually get that kind of Enterprise
[38:00] grade solution in place but the user has
[38:04] no idea how to provide those
[38:05] instructions
[38:07] right they're just it's like hey
[38:09] describe this process and you'd be like
[38:13] you're just gonna sit forever and you're
[38:15] gonna close the tab and you're gonna go
[38:16] to like Twitter and you're like oh let's
[38:18] go either see you know
[38:22] so making all that easier that is a
[38:24] customer experience the onboarding is
[38:26] really important
[38:27] um
[38:28] and then I think the company that gets
[38:30] it right will figure out
[38:32] uh not only the way to get it done but
[38:34] to make it fun make it fun for the user
[38:37] and then when it doesn't feel like work
[38:39] and it's easy and it's clear what you
[38:42] know what you need to provide and next
[38:43] steps and why we're going through the
[38:45] process
[38:46] then I think that that should be a
[38:48] really like a pretty good experience and
[38:52] part I think my um
[38:54] if I could solve one problem on the
[38:56] planet Earth it would be that
[38:58] doing business doing work is no longer a
[39:02] pain in the ass it's actually fun and
[39:04] enjoyable
[39:05] and if you get that
[39:08] when we get to that point
[39:10] it's gonna be like hey I'm
[39:13] we're all like at home claring or the
[39:16] internet or like in person with Friends
[39:19] building cool and it and people
[39:22] want to buy it and they're buying it
[39:24] from us
[39:25] that's that's the vision of where we
[39:26] need to where we need to be going all
[39:28] the other stuff needs to get out of the
[39:30] way
[39:31] and a lot of that is like collaboration
[39:34] I feel like has gotten in the way of
[39:37] everything everything needs to be
[39:38] reviewed I need to share this like get
[39:41] your feedback on no we're done with that
[39:43] we're not collaborating anymore
[39:45] not not like that I'd rather collaborate
[39:48] in different ways brainstorming like
[39:51] things that I enjoy collaborating on but
[39:53] most of the other stuff is total Walkers
[39:55] roadblocks and I think people want that
[39:59] sense of accomplishment like they they
[40:00] ship something it made a difference
[40:02] and and when you collaborate now no one
[40:05] owns
[40:07] like it's harder for people to own the
[40:09] outcome it's harder to get the learnings
[40:11] back through and iterate like oh well
[40:14] it didn't work right but that was
[40:16] probably because this other person's
[40:17] ideas sucked right or it's like no you
[40:20] need to learn why it didn't work and
[40:23] what's awesome with AI
[40:24] you can you can give it a a like a
[40:28] scenario
[40:29] you can tell them what you're gonna do
[40:31] and then you can ask for a list of 10
[40:33] reasons why it didn't work
[40:35] and it'll tell you
[40:38] I I love I love the mission of bringing
[40:41] the joy back to building helping
[40:42] everyone like ReDiscover that and really
[40:45] enjoy that this week I I went to get my
[40:49] world coin ID
[40:50] and get my eye scan by the orb their
[40:52] whole take is ai's gonna take away the
[40:54] job so we need Ubi to support us all and
[40:56] your take is the exact opposite which is
[40:58] AI is going to unlock creativity and
[41:00] productivity in a whole new way where
[41:01] anyone can create their version of the
[41:03] avocado backpack that is exactly the
[41:04] thing that someone out there wants and
[41:06] we can all you know improve each other's
[41:07] lives bills for each other collaborate
[41:09] in this like unconstrained ways
[41:11] yeah they are so full of so here's
[41:13] the problem
[41:15] I'm not saying that I just no I'm saying
[41:17] it here's the problem no here's the
[41:20] problem like one one of uh Peter thiel's
[41:23] YouTube videos like you were not a
[41:25] lottery ticket I don't know if y'all
[41:26] watched that changed my life and
[41:29] basically
[41:30] it boiled down to two things
[41:33] he loves the two by two quadrant right
[41:36] so things are in this quadrant was like
[41:39] optimistic pessimistic and then
[41:43] uh definite and indefinite
[41:46] and so
[41:48] this I'll have to explain it because I
[41:50] didn't I watched that thing like a few
[41:52] times I'm like what the is he
[41:53] talking about and then finally figured
[41:55] it out
[41:56] um I think I figured it out but again I
[41:59] don't know because
[42:00] I didn't ask him I don't know but the
[42:03] the key piece here let's say that
[42:05] they're optimistic like AJ is going to
[42:08] be great right
[42:09] okay but the there's this indefinite
[42:11] thing we don't know what what's gonna
[42:13] happen then
[42:14] that is a that's probably the most
[42:17] uh after I watched the video like the
[42:20] third time and I was reflecting on what
[42:23] I have been indefinite about in my own
[42:25] life it is it is absolutely the source
[42:29] of every problem in my life
[42:33] is that indefiniteness what do you mean
[42:35] by that
[42:37] the pandemic hit right
[42:40] and everybody's locked inside
[42:44] and you're like when is like when is
[42:46] life going to get back to normal
[42:48] right
[42:49] and then what's the answer Ben
[42:52] I don't know
[42:55] and you're in this state of un unknown
[42:59] with no definitive viewpoint on what the
[43:03] answer should be and a definite
[43:05] understanding of when we're going to
[43:07] turn this off and we're going to
[43:09] get back to whatever we want to do right
[43:12] and and you ask people I mean there are
[43:15] a lot of different things like one is
[43:18] um
[43:19] you know are you or do you want to find
[43:21] like do you want to get married do you
[43:23] want a spouse a husband a wife
[43:26] and they're say well not right now but
[43:27] like later on that's an indefinite
[43:29] answer right it's not a clear answer
[43:33] you went it's like well you ask anyone
[43:36] what is your career goal and they tell
[43:39] you
[43:40] and you ask them
[43:42] what have you done in the past year to
[43:45] get yourself closer to the career goal
[43:47] and the answer is almost always nothing
[43:49] they didn't do anything
[43:52] and so we're living in this world where
[43:55] we have agency right we can do stuff but
[43:58] no one is encouraging anyone to be
[44:01] definite about what that feature needs
[44:03] to look like
[44:04] and there's been zero pressure from
[44:06] anyone in public
[44:09] to encourage everybody to make that
[44:11] decision
[44:12] and then you get to this state where
[44:14] it's like cool we're going to build the
[44:16] most powerful computer system ever great
[44:18] well why
[44:20] well we don't know
[44:22] we don't have an answer
[44:24] so it's like do you think that like
[44:26] building it
[44:28] with no answer in mind is gonna doesn't
[44:31] that increase the odds that the outcome
[44:33] sucks
[44:35] and it doesn't actually achieve the
[44:36] vision that you wanted don't you have to
[44:38] get people on board to the vision
[44:41] in order to make sure that you're just
[44:44] getting all the benefits and not the
[44:45] part of it right
[44:48] like framing this stuff you were the
[44:50] leader you're leading the project in
[44:52] your best outcome is that everybody's on
[44:54] welfare all the time well
[44:56] telling people hey you shouldn't even
[44:58] study you shouldn't build anything
[45:00] because it's pointless
[45:02] right just give up that's that's the
[45:05] message that's being given to people
[45:07] give up there's no point it's hopeless
[45:10] AI is going to take everything it's
[45:11] going to replace you your job's gonna
[45:12] take your family you won't even have a
[45:14] family because you'll just see his AI
[45:15] Bots right you'll have an AI girlfriend
[45:18] you don't need kids just stay at home
[45:21] because it's cheaper like all this stuff
[45:22] to me it's just totally conflicts with
[45:26] my core
[45:27] human self it it's all conflicting
[45:31] and so when I see it and it's like
[45:33] you've gotten you've had success on 10
[45:35] different Avenues and then now you have
[45:36] this next thing
[45:37] it could not be different than like
[45:40] elon's version of Let's get to the next
[45:43] planet let's build an awesome City there
[45:46] civilization let's make you know improve
[45:49] like we have this climate problem let's
[45:51] go solve it this is how we're going to
[45:52] solve it definitively this is how we
[45:54] know we've gotten there even with the
[45:56] AGI stuff
[45:57] Define it it's like the definition is it
[46:00] does everything better than people I'm
[46:02] like that's a shitty thing to want to
[46:03] build
[46:04] right
[46:05] now there there's probably a better
[46:07] thing for me
[46:09] that would I build the same thing but
[46:11] for a different reason and it that then
[46:14] defines well who are you bringing into
[46:15] the project
[46:17] right if you think it's inevitable
[46:19] then don't you think a lot of those
[46:21] insights are going out the back door
[46:23] because you're inviting people that are
[46:25] extremely open to build a project with
[46:27] you these people are tweeting out on
[46:29] Twitter all the time
[46:30] and now are we really in a space race
[46:32] situation where you have Nation versus
[46:34] Nation with two fundamentally different
[46:36] political viewpoints
[46:39] right and it is that's important then
[46:41] why are we not why is this not a secure
[46:43] Zone where you're building this thing
[46:46] and no one's asking the question I
[46:48] haven't been asked the question
[46:51] um but it's it's like it's shocking it's
[46:53] basically shocking and the only person
[46:55] that is pissed is James Cameron he's
[46:58] like I told you guys about Terminator so
[47:01] what do you got Avatar like be and even
[47:03] him he is setting the vision for what
[47:06] the future is like with his movies
[47:09] so it's not a warning it's like people
[47:11] watch it and their takeaway is oh this
[47:13] is inevitable we're gonna get the
[47:14] Terminator and now I see people on
[47:15] Twitter giving robots access to these
[47:18] large language models with weapons and
[47:20] I'm like
[47:21] yeah that should clearly be illegal and
[47:23] nothing's happening and there are very
[47:25] few built Builders right now that are
[47:28] not influenced
[47:29] by those viewpoints the indefinite
[47:31] Viewpoint like I don't know what I want
[47:33] to build I'll I'll build something I'll
[47:35] launch it and just see if anybody cares
[47:38] right that's a very indefinite way to
[47:40] build without like a very clear sense of
[47:43] what needs to be accomplished
[47:46] because everything is a roadblock so how
[47:48] are you going to power through it if
[47:50] people say well I don't like that are
[47:51] you done right
[47:53] and Danny I think you mentioned this in
[47:55] like your post you're like Hey we're
[47:56] building stuff and testing it but you
[47:59] know you're just kind of like in the
[48:00] wilderness
[48:01] right without the confidence to go and
[48:04] say hey look this is actually what what
[48:07] would be really valuable let's go build
[48:08] it let's be a little bit more thoughtful
[48:10] about our approach to it yeah I think
[48:12] the out those outcomes are always going
[48:14] to be great
[48:16] like you're you're a manafric recipes
[48:18] you know like people come up to me all
[48:20] the time and say hey like you know how
[48:21] do I start a company how do I get to
[48:23] like 10 million users if you were to
[48:25] start a company today how and you did
[48:28] this or you went to 10 million users how
[48:29] do you how do you get to 10 million
[48:30] years what is the what are the steps
[48:34] uh well you need like the world's most
[48:37] powerful AI technology of all time to
[48:39] come out and then you need to to build a
[48:43] you know Simple app that takes it makes
[48:46] it useful so
[48:48] the at 99 percent of the time I'd say
[48:51] like the products are not really
[48:55] there's not enough new thing to attract
[48:58] that many people to it because you need
[49:00] something new right and technology is
[49:02] all about new things
[49:04] um and so the reason why we went all in
[49:07] when gbt3 launched
[49:09] was because it was clear to us that this
[49:12] is ushering in a new wave
[49:14] and it's a new tech platform and so when
[49:16] you get new tech platforms you usually
[49:18] have like a two-year period
[49:21] before people react and adopt
[49:23] right so what makes Twitter great is all
[49:27] the early adopters are on Twitter
[49:29] and they're actually the most active
[49:30] users
[49:31] so if you want feedback and if you want
[49:33] early users before your products
[49:35] polished that's the place to Launch
[49:37] and then they they share Word of Mouth
[49:40] like crazy like they are they influence
[49:43] the people in their you know family
[49:44] immediate like their business wherever
[49:47] but they are taste makers and so
[49:51] you can
[49:52] if you have something that is new enough
[49:56] and has like a broad Market appeal
[49:58] things that are like prosumer tools
[50:00] consumer things
[50:03] um
[50:04] you're more likely to hit those kinds of
[50:06] user metrics now
[50:08] the thing that's more valuable is like
[50:10] the value metric how do we how to
[50:12] actually create value for 10 million
[50:13] people that's a bigger like that's a
[50:15] real challenge to do
[50:18] um so I'd say be early to like the best
[50:21] technology wave of all time so that
[50:23] would be a that's my first g75 all right
[50:27] that's the first piece of advice the
[50:29] second one
[50:31] um yeah I think there's there's been a
[50:33] ton written about freemium like just
[50:36] allow people to use the thing so do
[50:38] whatever you can to make it free
[50:40] make it uh easy to access easy to use
[50:43] reduce all the friction for people
[50:44] testing it out trying it out
[50:47] um that helps then there there's all
[50:49] like the product LED growth uh tactics
[50:51] like sharing inviting collaborative
[50:54] features all that stuff helps a user
[50:57] bring in more people to the product
[51:00] and then I I do think that the
[51:03] running very hard and uh social media
[51:07] platforms like can do it through
[51:10] can't do it through ads
[51:12] um you can do it through influencer type
[51:14] campaigns where they're just you know
[51:16] highlighting your product and what it
[51:18] can do and just sharing that with their
[51:20] audience
[51:20] those things could give you such a
[51:23] breadth of awareness that you can
[51:25] actually it's a huge like brand
[51:27] marketing
[51:29] and brand marketing is one of those
[51:30] things that
[51:31] most of the time you don't see directly
[51:35] like the impact but it's like huge top
[51:38] of funnel driver and you're like oh
[51:40] these are low quality leads right but
[51:42] it's actually still the biggest volume
[51:43] of high qualities
[51:45] and then that brand awareness makes
[51:47] everything Downstream way easier
[51:50] everything becomes easier so it's like
[51:52] have like a huge like top of funnel
[51:54] growth focus on that even if it's like
[51:57] not very specific that's okay oh my God
[52:00] always
[52:02] yeah always unblock the top of final
[52:04] growth you can always
[52:06] figure out who you want to build for or
[52:07] what you want to focus on and narrow
[52:09] that down but to have the big top of
[52:11] funnel
[52:13] um gives you like these insane
[52:15] advantages where it's like oh yeah I've
[52:17] heard of them
[52:18] like in a in a B2B context like
[52:22] the people that are are trying to pitch
[52:24] other colleagues internally to use a
[52:27] product and the other people have
[52:28] already heard of it
[52:29] right and they have a positive
[52:30] impression of it
[52:32] there that's a game changer so at the 10
[52:35] million Mark you need to do something
[52:36] that's actually relevant now let's let's
[52:38] assume for a second I've never done this
[52:40] but let's assume for a second like you
[52:42] didn't have
[52:44] uh you are gonna build off some wave and
[52:47] you're gonna go off something totally
[52:49] new
[52:50] I would
[52:51] I would say it it needs to be
[52:53] um
[52:56] it needs to get into like the public
[52:58] Zeitgeist which is like
[53:01] the things that people talk about and
[53:03] all these narratives that are flowing
[53:04] around like news sites social media
[53:07] sites you'd want to pair really well
[53:09] with something there
[53:11] and you would want to make something
[53:12] that is going to take off like a rocket
[53:15] ship
[53:17] so I had one idea for like
[53:20] um
[53:20] an app that that detects like where uh
[53:25] like poop is San Francisco and then that
[53:27] guy built it
[53:28] and the second he built it he traded it
[53:31] out and it's called Snap crap
[53:35] when he tweeted out I'm like this is
[53:37] going places like I knew this was gonna
[53:40] work I just knew it because that was
[53:43] something people talk about and complain
[53:45] about and then he made an easy way for
[53:47] people to actually engage with the
[53:49] problem correctly
[53:51] which was to at least plot this stuff
[53:54] and actually bring awareness to it so
[53:55] and then he picked like a very viral
[53:57] name he got sued by Snapchat
[54:00] and had to shut the entire thing down
[54:02] but it was like it was like a single
[54:06] issue type thing and then he just went
[54:09] full uh all the way to the wall on it
[54:12] and it went totally viral people
[54:15] downloaded the app they were using it
[54:17] but then nothing happened
[54:20] like they would report all this stuff
[54:22] and the city wouldn't clean it up
[54:24] and so then it's like well what's the
[54:25] point of the app yeah it's like nothing
[54:29] because nothing's happening and so I was
[54:32] like dude you gotta actually solve the
[54:34] problem you know I'm thinking in my head
[54:35] I'm like you can actually solve this
[54:37] problem you know it's not enough to like
[54:38] put this put more tickets like with the
[54:41] city who's not solving it today you know
[54:44] what I mean so like my brain's going
[54:45] what are 10 you know they become instant
[54:48] prompts for like
[54:50] oh I use our copy AI chat to do 10
[54:53] prompts because it already knows about
[54:55] me
[54:55] 10 you know 10 ideas easy things to test
[54:58] to solve this x Problem whatever it is
[55:00] that problem comes out and you're like
[55:02] hey I want a more based orthogonal
[55:04] surprise me and then it gives you like
[55:06] the gold and you're like holy crap we
[55:08] could do that
[55:09] today and solve the problem with no
[55:12] money and that's the way you know that's
[55:14] the way to go about it uh so that that
[55:17] one went viral even though it was a tiny
[55:20] City like San Francisco is only like 500
[55:22] 000 people
[55:23] so how's how's something going viral
[55:26] across you know tens of millions of
[55:27] people
[55:29] when the market the target's only 500k
[55:31] like that's how big of a
[55:34] uh
[55:36] shareability thing right like you see
[55:38] that you're like oh this is funny you
[55:39] share with a friend that's when the
[55:41] thing explodes
[55:43] so I have a few I have a few ideas in
[55:46] that in that vein that are tricky where
[55:49] you have very clear problem statement
[55:51] but a very unclear solution
[55:54] to actually solving the problem
[55:57] how do you like manage your like kazuk
[56:00] you want to work on a lot of different
[56:01] things right but like you have this
[56:03] company that you have to run as more
[56:05] than 10 million users how do you stop
[56:06] yourself from attacking all these other
[56:09] problems that you're super excited about
[56:10] too cold cold cold turkey
[56:14] it's called turkey man I haven't touched
[56:16] any of this stuff okay so basically that
[56:19] trick is just not even think about it
[56:21] not even touch it or not even take a
[56:22] step closer I just I I'll add it to a
[56:25] list and I'll just move on I'll put the
[56:27] idea in a list
[56:29] that's a very smart way to manage that
[56:31] yeah and I'll just think back what am I
[56:33] building and why and I'm like okay this
[56:35] is going to help accelerate all that
[56:37] stuff but we gotta build this first
[56:39] yeah this is like the foundation this is
[56:41] the foundation yeah
[56:43] cool
[56:44] is there all right we need a part two
[56:48] guitar yeah
[56:51] it'd be cool to build dude it'd be cool
[56:53] to build something in real time 60
[56:55] Minutes yes and like live stream it too
[56:58] yeah yeah that would be awesome
[57:00] is anyone doing that probably
[57:02] on Twitch yeah no we should do it we
[57:06] should do it well fine I'll find
[57:07] something to build
[57:09] there's a lot like

you hit the pandemic shut down I start just brainstorming ideas I found a site called brambucket.com which has a logo and a website domain name and it's for sale and so I started browsing that thing I went through all 80 000 logos on that site every single one so hey everybody you are on 100 Builders today we have Paul yakubian with us with the CEO of copy.ai copy.ai uses generative AI to help anyone right compelling marketing copy instantly and Paul you have an ambitious goal to enable a billion new entrepreneurs by 2030 by helping anyone create and sell new products and services online it's it's so awesome to have you here it's not going to take until 2030. it's not going to take until 20 30. I guarantee that uh it's gonna be a lot faster than 2030 and um it'll just give you a little background about me I started out in the Middle School day trading stocks during the first tech bubble with my dad and we yeah they just come out of discount brokerages like online size where you can day trade and that was like really phenomenal so I could trade these like high-tech companies their IPOs it was an absurd time and whatever you bought made money so you feel like a genius and I'm like I'm only you know I'm only whatever 12. like this is easy money you know and so that's when I got addicted to technology they were talking about how valuable the internet was going to be and the Internet it's like oh wow all the information is going to be on there I can communicate with anyone in real time instantly for free I can find all this information out uh you know you'd have video like any kind of video archival footage music and you're just like this is insane like so much value is sitting in this big pool of resources and we're just continuing to add and add an add to it and so the question that I always had was this this internet thing is so big I can never consume all of it right so how do we actually access all the value that's in the internet to do things that are valuable for me or for you know my customer and so fast forward you had a stock crash I realized I didn't know anything about accounting or economics I went and did that in school became a CPA did the hedge fund thing did the Venture Capital thing and then I'll it did the Angel Investing thing and then I was like okay time to build and write like right as uh as deciding a bill it started like tweeting this is like late 2019 uh gpt2 it just come out so I started using that like text generally what can you do with this thing first thing very clear it was just at the point where the words made sense and I'm like okay this is this this is not a small feat because everything that people do can be commanded with Words which means that if you can generate words you can command anything you want and you can and uh and furthermore was not about factual accuracy in the beginning it's more like pure creativity and so that was totally counter to the narrative like oh we'll never replace creative jobs and it's you know I'm gonna do these factual things and I'm like this is absurd if you just use the thing right and so I was like okay how long you know nobody's ever good at predicting timelines I'm like how long is going to take before this is commercially viable where you could actually sell the words coming out of these these models and I you know I just make up a number five seven here or something like that right it's like oh it's gonna be seven years away so I started like just brainstorming like crazy uh ended up you know you hit the pandemic shut down I start just brainstorming ideas on in the PowerPoint deck I ended up with 170 ideas you know I was trying to figure out what are the triggers to all these ideas because you have ideas in your head like oh look that's a startup idea and then you forget it and it gets lost forever right and at some point like something triggers that idea to flood back into your brain you're like oh I forgot about that idea so I started writing it down and I started to try to find these tips and hacks to come out with more ideas and I find this I found a site called brambucket.com which has a logo and a website domain name and it's for sale and that would trigger ideas in my head just looking at the name this like domain name and so I started browsing that thing I went through all 80 000 logos on that site every single one I was like oh this is easy like I bet at some point you could just like feed this as an input and like an AI model could give you like 10 startup ideas off that thing right which you can do now well Paul all what all these ideas around like gp22 or like what do you what is just like all over the place just random stuff yeah just random stuff like you know I I was deconstructing just I mean it's random stuff like it's in your head most the ideas are stupid and dumb and I think those are probably the best ideas and those are the ones that get panned the hardest by your friends like your friends will laugh at it and then say that's really stupid that is the side of an amazing idea so the first one I put on there was called I made up this domain name as hugedance.com and the idea was you can't buy a dam in one click right so there's no e-commerce for like multi-billion dollar infrastructure of projects we're like damn like you know like the thing that like stops water from going like the Hoover Dam man yeah if you need a damn where are you gonna go get it right you can't just buy it now right so the whole idea behind that was like if you look at the search like SEO started falling like there's almost no no uh searches for that but like that one search you know like if you show up on that one search and you land the deal that's like a hundred million dollar referral fee right so these are like little baby call options and you can just set that thing up forever if you sell the damn you're done like you're good you know what I mean and that's something that's very very uh simple and uh the other thing I realized was like how do you how do you shrink the amount of MVP required to actually test some idea so I was a couple weeks ago at a Fourth of July party at friends house they've got like the whiskey Advocate magazine sitting on the table I'm like there should be one for rib eyes because I I eat ribeye right I just had a rib eye like where's the one for rib eyes so I'm like all right I'm gonna create like a ribeye magazine right so then the first thing I do in my brain is like let me get the domain names what are we talking about here right because that like sets the vision of the name and the whatever the brand so I got I ended up picking up ribeyemagazine.com uh ribeye advocate.com steakspectator.com so I got like three domains it's like 20 bucks right and then I'm like I don't like in my head I've got like the old I don't have like the best scoping mechanism naturally so I'm like oh I need like a physical I want a physical print magazine right and then I'm like that's so much effort to even try that out and so I built I build a lot of um AI prompts like all day long in our chat tool and then in our like conversational UI chats system prompts workflow automation so like the next thing I'm like can I just give this computer this idea and then have it give me like easy ideas it spits out like this MVP generator I throw the idea and it's like create like a Facebook group I'm like of course it's like just a Facebook group you know it's like created created Twitter handle it reads tweets about real eyes and I'm like Bingo that's it so like six minutes later I have like at ribeye magazine all I do is like I have one uh search term keyword which is like ribeye mentions minimum faves 100. I just run it every week and I retweet all the good stuff right and I'm like I'm ready to go if you look at that feed it's sick it's awesome it's like exactly what people you know in a very Niche demographic so Paul were you doing this were you doing this like when like the pandemic hit like you're just like at home retweeting rubai we need to have GPT we'd have we didn't have a chat like turbo models we didn't have a gpt4 so gbt3 was a little bit harder to do you had to give it examples in order for it to pattern match and so that was like that's just a pain in the butt but now you can just describe what you want boom it's done so I think that that is totally different I tried um one of the 170 ideas was um this is like a pain point uh if any of you all have had like family members move different countries like my dad came to the U.S he brought his family with him after he had settled here that moving is really hard and one of the one of the themes about moving is I don't want to just be the only person that moves I want to move like my whole crew with me and so then I was like oh man this is easy right it was like a software platform you sign up you invite all your family and friends and then this thing coordinates the entire move of like 100 000 people whatever it is and I realized like even in that idea when you take it to the Limit you're like how would Elon Musk like describe the mission it's like you were you were providing like Geographic freedom to large numbers of people all at once and so now imagine if you had you built that up and said okay what are where are we going what kind of place do we want to live in or what kind of city do we want to live in you could from scratch if you had the wait list of like 100 000 people ready to move you could build a new city it's silly right and then and then what I realized is he could apply that same thing like he could he could do this all over the place one of the things I want to do is like asteroid mining right just sell real estate on the ashtray to people now and then use the cash to fund the mission right this is like old school stuff this should be happening right now but there are so many things that I want to build and I'm like I there's not the infrastructure the platform for me to put the idea into it and then to set the idea in motion to make it happen so right now like at most a person can focus on one thing one core activity at a time one startup idea and then you're like if I do that it's like I'm I'm leaving all my other you know children out in the rain and I'm just like it's so sad right it's like that's not the future the future is that all the software and just lets the computers like handle all the details and then you're just going and pushing the mission of the things that you care about forward so when I look on Twitter none of that's happening anywhere like the only person that was really doing that was Elon and now he's like all in about Twitter and the politics of things like that is a that's a kind of like um it's like the death of your futuristic Vision Visionary right it's like we we we're trying to be futuristic and Visionary and moving things forward making progress and then the leader of that got bogged down right on a on an important Mission but one that does not bring you know it breaks negative people together um even like the I don't know is is Twitter Dart mode for you guys now on desktop now even things like that like light mode is great when I'm in dark mode I'm gonna complain about everything you know oh why why is that all they do first of all all the news is all the news right now is terrible like all international news domestic news political news a lot of economic news except for the actual facts that the economy is growing at two and a half percent which no one wants to bleed so I don't know I really think we have like a very we're just everybody's very divorced from reality right now if you're online which is not good because most people are online um so yeah anyway so I think I'm gonna have to like we're gonna opt out of the present day conversations that I think we do that as being like builders but then anyone building like we have to be way more vocal about what like the aspirational things that we're trying to like achieve and what we're trying to get to not company specific but just like what are the things that you know what are things we're passionate about what are the things we want accomplished for example one of those ideas I had was called uh it's like civilization in a box right so imagine you got a house in the suburbs like me I want to park a unit on there and I want to disconnect my house from the entire and I want to run it off the box so what's in the box if you got like a star link on there right you got some wastewater treatment thing in there you got some water reserves you've got a what I'll say battery backup solar like composting toilet all of that stuff can fit on a unit and the unit cost is like under 20 grand so this week I have not had water because we had a power outage our power was out for three days they put a they put a diesel generator right above the water reservoir in our suburb the diesel generator Elite Diesel into the water and so we're going to turn your water on it smells like diesel and they're like you can't drink the water this for six days and I'm like I I have lost civilization like it's way too centralized right now and we're just not taking care of it so we need to really rip it out so when I was thinking about civilization in a box my brain's gone well when you could you could rent your box out like if there's a hurricane it hits the Gulf Coast and people without power I could rent my box out and make the money back that that pays me for the thing that I had right and so just these little things would really it's like one after the next I'm like I need to do that I need to do that and then Dolly came out because I was like what the hell is this box gonna look like right nobody's gonna like buy a freaking uh Intermodal container right who wants to part you can't even park it with all the restrictions so with Dolly I like I literally just describe what's on the thing and it generated all these beautiful pictures of it I don't see if I can find some and once once I I'm gonna show it to you uh once I saw it I was like okay like just the visioning of it like physical stuff just visioning that product made it come absolutely to life and what's awesome is it's like you could do Infinity variations of it look at that oh wow that looks pretty cool that's not it this one so this was like an I I was like what if Apple made like a full body mass this is during covet I generate that I'm like that's awesome I'm like we could all still go out we could see each other's faces it'd be awesome I'm like you'd have like a container you could control your like oxygen levels you could pipe other things into this thing you could have ambient music in there right you could if it's too loud you could just tune it down I'm like this whole thing there's like an apple based environment um and I was like yeah I need I need to build that too then you get into like really more industrial type stuff you know but you can really look at that that's like a freaking throat you put that in your pitch deck you know what I mean that's something that rivian would build everybody well Tesla needs to build this for sure because they they could put one in every house um so those are things I'm like man all this stuff's gonna exist on some kind of timeline but I'm only one human right how do we how do well in the business part's in the way the entire like here's the idea we have a vision of it right we need to name it we need a website we need a landing page we need a pre-order form we need like a stripe account we need a uh you know incorporation I need to figure out which people on planet Earth care about this Mission and would want to join the company and I need to get them on board and then I need to get like I mean it's probably gonna be made overseas right but like I need to get the costs of doing it overseas I need to get the cost of it doing in the US I need a prod project manager and then I need a way to fulfill all this stuff I don't know like I've seen Elon do that with his team but like I don't know how to do any of that stuff and so it probably just comes down this is where you have like the unknown right where you're like what would we do first what's the most important thing to do first probably slap a landing page up tweet it out with a wait list put some price tag on there like probably just back of the envelope calc about how much it would cost put a price tag on there get the waitlist up you got the wait list now it's like hand to hand combat with the seed investors right maybe you have a prototype and you're just showing demo videos all day long of you building it like that would also work um and I think you get this whole thing off the ground and like I don't know like six weeks with like 10 grand you know and and think about the numbers if you price it up a hundred grand and you've got like a thousand orders how much is that in sales it's like a hundred million dollars right it's sick okay so if you got one order per one million impressions on Twitter then you just need Auto million impressions then you just need like Elon to say haha or something like that and then retweet it right and then you got like that six million impressions you've got six orders so it doesn't take that long but that thing needs to be very beautiful and the thing I've noticed about uh it's specifically like consumer products you've got Apple they just hire all the designers there are no designers left for anyone else they have hired them all right they they freaking hired all of them and they have like three products I'm like why are you doing this to every like you're doing this to Humanity so that's kind of disappointing you know what I mean they have like 10 000 designers at that company and three products so and the iPhone design doesn't really change so like where what are what are they doing and why are they not working for other you know people with more innovative ideas I don't know so so you're sitting there it's the beginning of the pandemic you're having Dolly generate your boxes you're like resisting the urge to sell Downs no no no that was the next year so 2020 you wouldn't have dolly you didn't have uh anything until Dali that first blog post they didn't release anything but they showed like the avocado backpack I think that was I don't know if that was January is that what's behind you yeah I made it I got it made this backpack costs 200 bucks fully custom and I got it in under a month from the date of generating the idea to do this do you know what you have to do I didn't know how to get a backpack all right go on upwork you find a buyer agent who can get things made overseas all right I found one lady she's incredible she's incredible most Buyer Agents are not great I I've interviewed and brought in four I built a little air table to track these projects I had a few things made and then they go on like AliExpress and there's like the like Chinese the Chinese manufacturer all they do is backpacks they do like probably a billion or a trillion backpacks a year they will do custom one-offs for like 100 bucks and then the shipping's like 60. so to make a product fantastic all comes down to the the like the design details which Dolly didn't have I had like the front version of the bag and they're like all right what what's the inside look like I'm like then I go to the back look like I'm like I don't know you know so she helped me really like pick the materials out she really loved the project and then when they built the backpack they even sent me this like full-on product Showcase Video they were so happy that they got to build something like that and there was so much pride in it and people were like oh it's like an AI generated backpack it's like no actually I described what I wanted I curated the one I wanted someone helped me find someone to make it the people made it they picked the materials out like these are very human oriented process right now and that outfit's great so like I use you know that's my bag uh I take it everywhere I get a lot of yeah a lot of compliments on it but it's also like it actually gets the job done I got other things made that were crap like I would not would not recommend this uh I had like it was like a track suit you know and I'm like sending them like all these like futuristic Blade Runner style like tracksuit designs and ideas and then I get it and it's like just it'd be like an eight dollar like Walmart like warm-up thing with terrible colors and I was like this is not what I wanted yeah they're like oh okay we understand what you want like that would be sixteen hundred dollars and I'm like I'm not doing that so then I know it could everything can be made but it's just a matter of the one are you working at the right people to do it and then two like are you okay with whatever the cost is but it was that was a that was pretty fun my um I showed this dolly to my kids my four-year-old she was like I want a chicken hat it generated that I'm like that's that's amazing um they wanted to do if I had if I had a little bit of extra time I would actually build the toilet car that she described like an operational functioning toilet on a car I wish I had that in Bangladesh when I was growing up you know I mean if I tweet a video of that thing working it's gonna get all the views like it would go Infinity viral it would be like 10 10 grand to build it I just don't have enough time um there was so many ideas how did you why did you decide to work on copy um I'll get to that in a second okay here's here's the other one here are three more boxes now like all right the other one's like Cloud cities floating cities like how do we make floating cities happen right I'm like I don't know like hot air like two hot air balloons with like a zip line in between it you can zipline like yes okay we have to do that as people right and somebody's like oh there there is this like vacuum system that that's been theorized as possible it could have like a vacuum balloon and that could pull stuff and I'm like what would that look like and then I try to describe it as as however I can and then Dolly's like oh like that and I'm like that is incredible I don't think my mind was so fun with Dolly it was like I'm just feeding it more things I like in the end of the input prompt and then my mind was just getting blunt I was up I don't I go to bed pretty like I go to bed around 10 10 30. I was up till like 3 A.M just like let me see this next set let me see this next item it was it was way too much once the models got realistic I lost interest because by definition there's nothing new about the realism and then when it's too real it doesn't give your mind like an an area to create around right because it's already filled in all the gaps and detail site I do think like that first uh the jankier the image generator the more fun it is and and it it kind of operates in a um it's kind of counterintuitive but you really want the the model to be going and doing expanding your mind right that's where I find the most value in in the imagen side um but now it's like hyper realistic you can see The Sweat Beads you know on the forehead and I'm like who cares like why why are we doing this I I have I have an unimportant question um when you were prompting Dolly here are you like two hot air balloons with a zip line or are you like two hot air balloons and a zip line in the style of blank 4K yeah what what's your what's the prop magic for I stopped doing Imaging because I'm like I'm either gonna I'm gonna go down some kind of round so I had to like wean myself off that tool uh at that time I liked Sid Mead he was the illustrator of The Blade Runner series and when you use in the style said me it puts everything into like this futuristic Escape which I think is really nice and then he could pair that with um shapes that I like like these bucky ball shapes which is like the you know Epcot type uh things and then when you put those two together usually it's like I want to see the thing in some kind of landscape either like floating over like San Francisco a city or something like that I don't even live in San Francisco but over a city uh or like in a Suburban like driveway which should sit like in my neck of the woods right so those are the things like it makes it more real but and and that is the idea with the visuals is like how do you how do you create yeah how do you envision Advanced Technologies that are so accessible because of where you put them in in the landscape that it makes it more real and then it increases in your brain the likelihood that you can build it because if you think you can't build it or it's too complicated you are not you could just move on to a different idea because that that's not going to take you anywhere um and so now I've got like this um insane backlog of stuff that used to get about and then I was like man all these once we did that I took the 180 ideas and categorized them by theme and there was a whole like there were six theme categories I don't remember the name of it uh all of them because I don't want to if I dust off that list I get very tempted to go build that stuff but the first the core category like what's the enabling category it was all around business processes and scaling the best business processes and learning from world-class things and applying that directly into the flow of how a business gets set up grows because I was like man the bottleneck isn't the ideation I have I have plenty of ideas the bottleneck is how do we get anything done how do we actually take an idea get it to Market and get it to the point where it can it can uh run on its own and um elon's done a great job of that like he's got a car company kind of running on its own he's got SpaceX kind of running on its own you know I think that's that's pretty absurd but that's the approach he's taken so in my head I'm like well any of these like SAS SAS companies should be the easiest to go full auto with um and then because you already not only do you have like everything is scoped and defined in code which is all text anyway but like even the best practices we know who the people are that have the best advice the best insights right we know them by name we know they're doing everything about them so you can start with like hey let's take the YC advice put that into a prompt and then ask it what it would do and it's like oh here great ideas you can take uh you should take like reforge content put it in a prompt and you can see what it will it would do or recommend um and so I think there there will be there is a lag right now between that capability and and professionals understanding of how to access it this is like an onboarding problem it's a generative AI and then um beyond that it's more like okay how do we actually deploy these insights a little bit you know with less friction in the companies so those are the problems that I'm I'm trying to solve now and then if once you unblock that it's game over because every single idea has a straight path towards validating every step that needs to get validated the MVP generator is scoping everything down into something that's very like possible to do within an hour or right now and then most of that stuff is being tailored because a lot of it's messaging right I need to find people I need to find vendors um I need to build like like a simple road map for a deck all that stuff is like easy to replicate now and with generative Ai and so that is uh those are increasingly solved problems now you stack them up in a row and you actually have a full-on business generation system which is the whole point and so once you build that once we build that out and that's what we're building uh marketing is so key to that like how do you structure the right landing page what are the benefits what are the pain points who are your customers what's the audience where do I find them who are they on LinkedIn how do we message them like those are the those are the blockers for everybody and so once you unblock that stuff now you can unleash all this creativity and that's what the models really Thrive at they Thrive at creativity because they want or they're probabilistic by Nature they Crank That temperature up give it some uh I got a prompt it's like my based prompt it's like hey be more bass be orthogonal like surprise me like all this stuff and it's like oh it throws you all these ideas right that are not average it's not just regurgitating like middle of the road stuff which most people find boring including myself uh yesterday I was like I was terminating uh something I was like hey we don't have customer success like generate like a customer success program and it did it the very basic one and I was like try again but do things that don't escape wow it sounds like here's like a like use this approach the Y combinator recommends right when you're finding private Market fit boom everything came out perfect I'm like that's what I want right I want to meet these people in person I want to do manual onboarding I want to send them swag all that stuff came out in that list but in that first list it was very boring and basic stuff so even things like that like how do you go from a now in my head everything's related right you have that initial prompt you can ask the model and say hey what's a better prompt right what's the one like what's a different way of structuring the problem everything it turns out is just variations and it's just variations on variations in brainstorming lists so that to me is like is golden and I'm like again there's so much stuff to build I'm like how are we gonna just we how do we figure out how to onboard more people in the into these types of platforms like ours where they can become ins like orders of magnitude more productive not just like hey I need help writing an email like one email that's not that's not transformational but it's an amazing first step for a lot of people because you can immediately see the value in it the time to the aha moment is like three seconds so even when you look at like uh all these like session link stats I don't know if y'all saw the character AI it's got like 30 minute sessions uh like gpt's guy like eight minute sessions I'm like they're like it's not you know it's fall like it's falling or whatever like the whole point is that the session's short right but every every product's designed to be to read right and get people to use it more so that begs the question what is the goal if if we're trying to get people to use this stuff more what what is the goal that we need to be promising people to say okay if you use our product more you're going to get more of what right so right now it's like we're gonna save you time okay well then you know why use the product you know at all when I just put it into an automation so that really is step one you do need to automate a lot of this stuff but you don't want to lose that creativity at the same time so you have to master the the Dark Art of prompt engineering and not not necessarily just tying these systems together but actually how do you get the best uh how do you get the models to act like actually capable people so that's what's up and then um now now we're moving in when you move into onboarding onboarding is the product like you guys have heard this before like if I like we built a system it's so powerful everybody like gpt4 insanely powerful you look at how people use it how are these in it they're not like people aren't even using it right wait are you serious most people are not using gpt4 for everything all day long right what is the onboarding what's the user onboarding for for gbt4 um oh you have to confirm that you understand that this is experimental and then it yeah there is none this isn't the same right so you're everyone's having to discover how to even use it and then that needs to get translated back into some kind of onboarding to teach people how to use and and that onboard needs to be personalized and make it so that it's actually relevant useful for them so we're in that process like okay we if we we really just need to help people figure out what they can do with it and how it's relevant to them so all of the things that this is where they do things that don't scale is like it is the best approach because everything now we're doing manually one-to-one onboarding asking questions Discovery all that stuff can be replicated now in in a product inside the product inside of an onboarding but you have to build it and then you have to improve it it need a system that does that and so that's where you get into engineering um so that's what we're currently working on is improving all of that but I'd say that the the vision that most companies have like oh AI transformation like where are we gonna go they can they can already Envision that they they'd actually that's not a problem in terms of visioning it they just they need help getting there and so guess what's really good at taking a vision in a current state and breaking it down into series of steps yeah it's pretty good and it's pretty good at that right so it's like AI all the way down um so the next yeah I think people were like well what's I think there is some disappointment probably around like there's a lot of AI hype there's you know maybe things were oversold one of the things we've you know noticed immediately was Enterprise use cases are tricky like there are a lot of details you got to get right to get it to that level right so with gpt4 is like that you know we thought we knew three wasn't going to get there we need three and a half it's not quite good enough but four is actually good enough to follow enough instructions well enough to actually get that kind of Enterprise grade solution in place but the user has no idea how to provide those instructions right they're just it's like hey describe this process and you'd be like you're just gonna sit forever and you're gonna close the tab and you're gonna go to like Twitter and you're like oh let's go either see you know so making all that easier that is a customer experience the onboarding is really important um and then I think the company that gets it right will figure out uh not only the way to get it done but to make it fun make it fun for the user and then when it doesn't feel like work and it's easy and it's clear what you know what you need to provide and next steps and why we're going through the process then I think that that should be a really like a pretty good experience and part I think my um if I could solve one problem on the planet Earth it would be that doing business doing work is no longer a pain in the ass it's actually fun and enjoyable and if you get that when we get to that point it's gonna be like hey I'm we're all like at home claring or the internet or like in person with Friends building cool and it and people want to buy it and they're buying it from us that's that's the vision of where we need to where we need to be going all the other stuff needs to get out of the way and a lot of that is like collaboration I feel like has gotten in the way of everything everything needs to be reviewed I need to share this like get your feedback on no we're done with that we're not collaborating anymore not not like that I'd rather collaborate in different ways brainstorming like things that I enjoy collaborating on but most of the other stuff is total Walkers roadblocks and I think people want that sense of accomplishment like they they ship something it made a difference and and when you collaborate now no one owns like it's harder for people to own the outcome it's harder to get the learnings back through and iterate like oh well it didn't work right but that was probably because this other person's ideas sucked right or it's like no you need to learn why it didn't work and what's awesome with AI you can you can give it a a like a scenario you can tell them what you're gonna do and then you can ask for a list of 10 reasons why it didn't work and it'll tell you I I love I love the mission of bringing the joy back to building helping everyone like ReDiscover that and really enjoy that this week I I went to get my world coin ID and get my eye scan by the orb their whole take is ai's gonna take away the job so we need Ubi to support us all and your take is the exact opposite which is AI is going to unlock creativity and productivity in a whole new way where anyone can create their version of the avocado backpack that is exactly the thing that someone out there wants and we can all you know improve each other's lives bills for each other collaborate in this like unconstrained ways yeah they are so full of so here's the problem I'm not saying that I just no I'm saying it here's the problem no here's the problem like one one of uh Peter thiel's YouTube videos like you were not a lottery ticket I don't know if y'all watched that changed my life and basically it boiled down to two things he loves the two by two quadrant right so things are in this quadrant was like optimistic pessimistic and then uh definite and indefinite and so this I'll have to explain it because I didn't I watched that thing like a few times I'm like what the is he talking about and then finally figured it out um I think I figured it out but again I don't know because I didn't ask him I don't know but the the key piece here let's say that they're optimistic like AJ is going to be great right okay but the there's this indefinite thing we don't know what what's gonna happen then that is a that's probably the most uh after I watched the video like the third time and I was reflecting on what I have been indefinite about in my own life it is it is absolutely the source of every problem in my life is that indefiniteness what do you mean by that the pandemic hit right and everybody's locked inside and you're like when is like when is life going to get back to normal right and then what's the answer Ben I don't know and you're in this state of un unknown with no definitive viewpoint on what the answer should be and a definite understanding of when we're going to turn this off and we're going to get back to whatever we want to do right and and you ask people I mean there are a lot of different things like one is um you know are you or do you want to find like do you want to get married do you want a spouse a husband a wife and they're say well not right now but like later on that's an indefinite answer right it's not a clear answer you went it's like well you ask anyone what is your career goal and they tell you and you ask them what have you done in the past year to get yourself closer to the career goal and the answer is almost always nothing they didn't do anything and so we're living in this world where we have agency right we can do stuff but no one is encouraging anyone to be definite about what that feature needs to look like and there's been zero pressure from anyone in public to encourage everybody to make that decision and then you get to this state where it's like cool we're going to build the most powerful computer system ever great well why well we don't know we don't have an answer so it's like do you think that like building it with no answer in mind is gonna doesn't that increase the odds that the outcome sucks and it doesn't actually achieve the vision that you wanted don't you have to get people on board to the vision in order to make sure that you're just getting all the benefits and not the part of it right like framing this stuff you were the leader you're leading the project in your best outcome is that everybody's on welfare all the time well telling people hey you shouldn't even study you shouldn't build anything because it's pointless right just give up that's that's the message that's being given to people give up there's no point it's hopeless AI is going to take everything it's going to replace you your job's gonna take your family you won't even have a family because you'll just see his AI Bots right you'll have an AI girlfriend you don't need kids just stay at home because it's cheaper like all this stuff to me it's just totally conflicts with my core human self it it's all conflicting and so when I see it and it's like you've gotten you've had success on 10 different Avenues and then now you have this next thing it could not be different than like elon's version of Let's get to the next planet let's build an awesome City there civilization let's make you know improve like we have this climate problem let's go solve it this is how we're going to solve it definitively this is how we know we've gotten there even with the AGI stuff Define it it's like the definition is it does everything better than people I'm like that's a shitty thing to want to build right now there there's probably a better thing for me that would I build the same thing but for a different reason and it that then defines well who are you bringing into the project right if you think it's inevitable then don't you think a lot of those insights are going out the back door because you're inviting people that are extremely open to build a project with you these people are tweeting out on Twitter all the time and now are we really in a space race situation where you have Nation versus Nation with two fundamentally different political viewpoints right and it is that's important then why are we not why is this not a secure Zone where you're building this thing and no one's asking the question I haven't been asked the question um but it's it's like it's shocking it's basically shocking and the only person that is pissed is James Cameron he's like I told you guys about Terminator so what do you got Avatar like be and even him he is setting the vision for what the future is like with his movies so it's not a warning it's like people watch it and their takeaway is oh this is inevitable we're gonna get the Terminator and now I see people on Twitter giving robots access to these large language models with weapons and I'm like yeah that should clearly be illegal and nothing's happening and there are very few built Builders right now that are not influenced by those viewpoints the indefinite Viewpoint like I don't know what I want to build I'll I'll build something I'll launch it and just see if anybody cares right that's a very indefinite way to build without like a very clear sense of what needs to be accomplished because everything is a roadblock so how are you going to power through it if people say well I don't like that are you done right and Danny I think you mentioned this in like your post you're like Hey we're building stuff and testing it but you know you're just kind of like in the wilderness right without the confidence to go and say hey look this is actually what what would be really valuable let's go build it let's be a little bit more thoughtful about our approach to it yeah I think the out those outcomes are always going to be great like you're you're a manafric recipes you know like people come up to me all the time and say hey like you know how do I start a company how do I get to like 10 million users if you were to start a company today how and you did this or you went to 10 million users how do you how do you get to 10 million years what is the what are the steps uh well you need like the world's most powerful AI technology of all time to come out and then you need to to build a you know Simple app that takes it makes it useful so the at 99 percent of the time I'd say like the products are not really there's not enough new thing to attract that many people to it because you need something new right and technology is all about new things um and so the reason why we went all in when gbt3 launched was because it was clear to us that this is ushering in a new wave and it's a new tech platform and so when you get new tech platforms you usually have like a two-year period before people react and adopt right so what makes Twitter great is all the early adopters are on Twitter and they're actually the most active users so if you want feedback and if you want early users before your products polished that's the place to Launch and then they they share Word of Mouth like crazy like they are they influence the people in their you know family immediate like their business wherever but they are taste makers and so you can if you have something that is new enough and has like a broad Market appeal things that are like prosumer tools consumer things um you're more likely to hit those kinds of user metrics now the thing that's more valuable is like the value metric how do we how to actually create value for 10 million people that's a bigger like that's a real challenge to do um so I'd say be early to like the best technology wave of all time so that would be a that's my first g75 all right that's the first piece of advice the second one um yeah I think there's there's been a ton written about freemium like just allow people to use the thing so do whatever you can to make it free make it uh easy to access easy to use reduce all the friction for people testing it out trying it out um that helps then there there's all like the product LED growth uh tactics like sharing inviting collaborative features all that stuff helps a user bring in more people to the product and then I I do think that the running very hard and uh social media platforms like can do it through can't do it through ads um you can do it through influencer type campaigns where they're just you know highlighting your product and what it can do and just sharing that with their audience those things could give you such a breadth of awareness that you can actually it's a huge like brand marketing and brand marketing is one of those things that most of the time you don't see directly like the impact but it's like huge top of funnel driver and you're like oh these are low quality leads right but it's actually still the biggest volume of high qualities and then that brand awareness makes everything Downstream way easier everything becomes easier so it's like have like a huge like top of funnel growth focus on that even if it's like not very specific that's okay oh my God always yeah always unblock the top of final growth you can always figure out who you want to build for or what you want to focus on and narrow that down but to have the big top of funnel um gives you like these insane advantages where it's like oh yeah I've heard of them like in a in a B2B context like the people that are are trying to pitch other colleagues internally to use a product and the other people have already heard of it right and they have a positive impression of it there that's a game changer so at the 10 million Mark you need to do something that's actually relevant now let's let's assume for a second I've never done this but let's assume for a second like you didn't have uh you are gonna build off some wave and you're gonna go off something totally new I would I would say it it needs to be um it needs to get into like the public Zeitgeist which is like the things that people talk about and all these narratives that are flowing around like news sites social media sites you'd want to pair really well with something there and you would want to make something that is going to take off like a rocket ship so I had one idea for like um an app that that detects like where uh like poop is San Francisco and then that guy built it and the second he built it he traded it out and it's called Snap crap when he tweeted out I'm like this is going places like I knew this was gonna work I just knew it because that was something people talk about and complain about and then he made an easy way for people to actually engage with the problem correctly which was to at least plot this stuff and actually bring awareness to it so and then he picked like a very viral name he got sued by Snapchat and had to shut the entire thing down but it was like it was like a single issue type thing and then he just went full uh all the way to the wall on it and it went totally viral people downloaded the app they were using it but then nothing happened like they would report all this stuff and the city wouldn't clean it up and so then it's like well what's the point of the app yeah it's like nothing because nothing's happening and so I was like dude you gotta actually solve the problem you know I'm thinking in my head I'm like you can actually solve this problem you know it's not enough to like put this put more tickets like with the city who's not solving it today you know what I mean so like my brain's going what are 10 you know they become instant prompts for like oh I use our copy AI chat to do 10 prompts because it already knows about me 10 you know 10 ideas easy things to test to solve this x Problem whatever it is that problem comes out and you're like hey I want a more based orthogonal surprise me and then it gives you like the gold and you're like holy crap we could do that today and solve the problem with no money and that's the way you know that's the way to go about it uh so that that one went viral even though it was a tiny City like San Francisco is only like 500 000 people so how's how's something going viral across you know tens of millions of people when the market the target's only 500k like that's how big of a uh shareability thing right like you see that you're like oh this is funny you share with a friend that's when the thing explodes so I have a few I have a few ideas in that in that vein that are tricky where you have very clear problem statement but a very unclear solution to actually solving the problem how do you like manage your like kazuk you want to work on a lot of different things right but like you have this company that you have to run as more than 10 million users how do you stop yourself from attacking all these other problems that you're super excited about too cold cold cold turkey it's called turkey man I haven't touched any of this stuff okay so basically that trick is just not even think about it not even touch it or not even take a step closer I just I I'll add it to a list and I'll just move on I'll put the idea in a list that's a very smart way to manage that yeah and I'll just think back what am I building and why and I'm like okay this is going to help accelerate all that stuff but we gotta build this first yeah this is like the foundation this is the foundation yeah cool is there all right we need a part two guitar yeah it'd be cool to build dude it'd be cool to build something in real time 60 Minutes yes and like live stream it too yeah yeah that would be awesome is anyone doing that probably on Twitch yeah no we should do it we should do it well fine I'll find something to build there's a lot like
