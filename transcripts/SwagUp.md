[00:00] [Music]
[00:10] thank you
[00:13] [Music]
[00:17] all right awesome well welcome back to
[00:19] the Out of the Woods podcast it's the
[00:20] first time that we've had three people
[00:22] or two guests but three people total so
[00:24] this is going to be either a [ __ ] show
[00:26] or pretty amazing and fun so we'll
[00:28] figure it out we'll probably talk over
[00:30] each other a few different times uh we
[00:32] have Chris Liu and Paul Jacobian I think
[00:35] I think I said it right he just told me
[00:36] and I probably still mess it up yeah
[00:39] that's close enough that's enough from
[00:41] copy.ai
[00:43] um also been following the journey on
[00:45] Twitter for for a while you're very big
[00:47] on the build in public ethos why do you
[00:50] why do you share everything on Twitter
[00:51] what's the what's the idea there
[00:54] well we uh you know Elon Musk does it
[00:57] and it worked really well for him
[00:59] so we thought we'd like causation or
[01:01] correlation
[01:04] for Elon he shared his vision
[01:06] for everything he does and when you
[01:08] share the vision that's how you actually
[01:10] motivate people for like
[01:12] like assess whether anyone thinks it's
[01:13] Andrew
[01:15] whether anyone's gonna want to work
[01:19] so you end up with this insane growth
[01:21] flywheel that helps you get any I any
[01:24] dumb idea any idea at all really off the
[01:26] ground very quickly and you get traction
[01:29] and he's done it over and over and over
[01:31] again and that's what
[01:37] so is the copy AI Vision interesting
[01:40] enough to get that same result
[01:46] it's a little bit
[01:52] of like what the mission is a little bit
[01:54] harder when you're starting out with
[01:56] like self-service SAS to like have that
[02:00] same level of excitement around the
[02:01] vision
[02:03] um but I think in general like even
[02:05] um I think AI is continuing to get more
[02:08] impressive and I think that that that's
[02:10] where you're going to get a lot of the
[02:11] excitement and just in terms of the Raw
[02:14] practical uh yeah usefulness of the
[02:17] Technologies that's where we're building
[02:19] I think I think like Dolly has kind of
[02:21] been a bit of a Tipping Point because
[02:22] it's so visual like everyone finally
[02:24] sees like oh my gosh like AI is finally
[02:27] getting to a point where it's really
[02:28] useful and interesting whereas you know
[02:31] we've talked about AI for so long do you
[02:33] feel kind of the same way that like the
[02:35] you were at a Tipping Point where it's
[02:36] starting to become kind of a mass Market
[02:38] thing that people realize is like here
[02:40] now
[02:43] uh yeah we've we've hit that moment um
[02:47] first
[02:48] first time was with IBM Watson and IBM's
[02:52] like hey it can do Jeopardy room better
[02:54] than these contestants it was like a
[02:56] very negative way of
[02:59] like a very pessimistic view of the
[03:01] future where computers just outsmart
[03:03] humans at every turn and you can't beat
[03:05] them
[03:06] um that was one reason why we didn't
[03:08] never really cared about
[03:11] because of the way that
[03:12] marketed Watson as it turns out Watson
[03:15] doesn't have like they haven't been able
[03:18] to actually showcase all that value
[03:21] that's kind of like IBM's different
[03:23] track record right in general now
[03:26] they you can you can create models to do
[03:30] specific tasks it's just really hard to
[03:32] scale that out across you know millions
[03:34] of people and they they were able to
[03:36] like generate Revenue you know
[03:37] Enterprise Revenue constantly with
[03:40] it's really more services than product
[03:43] Revenue what changed was the Transformer
[03:47] model architecture that was released in
[03:50] a paper by researchers from Google in
[03:52] 2017 that outlined a path to
[03:55] um really like increasingly powerful
[03:58] text generation models and language
[04:00] prediction models
[04:01] that um that got the open AI team really
[04:04] interested in like turning those into
[04:07] kind of Open Source models
[04:12] that was the our first taste like Chris
[04:13] and I's first taste of x
[04:15] is on these textual
[04:17] and when it came out it could just auto
[04:19] complete and so I would just like sit in
[04:22] front of my computer write out some like
[04:25] sci-fi product story thing and then just
[04:29] get it to generate ideas for me and I
[04:31] was just clicking it like is that kind
[04:33] of like the Gmail like where you start
[04:35] typing something you know like say hey
[04:36] did you mean to like say this basically
[04:39] yes so Gmail like they they are
[04:42] intentionally very conservative and
[04:44] they're gonna
[04:45] you know just kind of auto complete that
[04:47] sentence but what was great about this
[04:48] was it's so open-ended it could just go
[04:50] off in rails and that was this creative
[04:52] aspect that was way underappreciated
[04:55] now the problem with gpt2 is like it was
[04:58] the first Model that could kind of make
[05:00] sense but it could only make sense like
[05:02] 10 percent
[05:03] the other 90 is like a word jumble and
[05:06] you're like I'm trying to understand
[05:07] what's going on but I don't really
[05:09] understand it
[05:10] and that little taste that 10 taste was
[05:14] enough of a value for me to want to
[05:16] continue to use the product but then
[05:18] there was like a one in a hundred result
[05:21] that was a total Gem and you're like
[05:24] this is this is better than any person
[05:26] could ever imagine
[05:27] like I've never even like it's just so
[05:29] mind-blowing to me I was like this is
[05:31] mind expanding and it's creative
[05:34] yep
[05:35] and that's so once I saw that and once
[05:38] you know Chris saw that we were like hey
[05:40] what what's this going to look like in
[05:42] 10 years from now like if we're on some
[05:44] kind of trend line of improvement in
[05:46] these core models what will this look
[05:48] like continue
[05:50] fast forward six months
[05:52] and they release gpt3 which is a hundred
[05:55] times the size Michael what does it mean
[05:57] 100 times the size of just the
[05:58] processing power just the capabilities
[06:02] like the number of parameters
[06:05] yeah it's a uh well actually I think
[06:08] it's a little more than six months Paul
[06:09] uh talk to Transformer stuff from the
[06:12] time that we yeah from the time that we
[06:14] were using GPT
[06:16] longer than that it might have been a
[06:18] year and a half actually
[06:20] but um that's digressing
[06:22] um basically the model size is a it's
[06:26] like basically how how many parameters
[06:28] is this like model tracking right and
[06:31] there was a big belief when GPT 3
[06:34] launched that it's like wow this is 175
[06:36] billion parameter it just means it's
[06:38] like a proxy for the size of the model
[06:40] and it was a hundred times bigger than
[06:43] gpc2 since that period of time we've
[06:46] learned that size actually isn't the
[06:49] end-all be-all and having more data
[06:51] might be but we can go into that a
[06:53] little later so is is Chris kind of the
[06:56] highly technical part of the partnership
[06:58] and Paul you're like the go to market
[07:00] it's a little bit yeah he Chris Chris
[07:04] built out like our whole first version
[07:06] of the app
[07:07] I'm I play it small
[07:10] you're just the Tweeter right you know
[07:12] we chat we chat strategy I've handled
[07:15] like
[07:18] like kind of divide it up a little bit
[07:19] but how did you guys meet and you know
[07:21] initially and then how did you come
[07:22] about like you know open Ai and then how
[07:25] did you decide like this is something
[07:27] worth pursuing
[07:30] great question so we met at a venture
[07:32] fund that we worked at today
[07:34] so we had been working together for
[07:37] the fun we were at helped employees
[07:39] exercise their stock options so for
[07:42] Chris and I we got to invest in hundreds
[07:44] of venture back startup startup and we
[07:46] got to see the entire eco
[07:48] ecos basically every company post
[07:53] all the way you know all the way to IPO
[07:55] and you would end up helping the
[07:57] employee base exercise their options
[08:02] so we get to see every business model
[08:04] you got to see all these great companies
[08:06] you got to figure out where the
[08:08] frontiers of Technology were based on
[08:10] basically and then you got a really good
[08:11] sense of like all right where are things
[08:13] headed you know what's the next big wave
[08:15] of Nation
[08:17] and you had seen like the mobile wave
[08:19] roll through you'd seen satin like
[08:22] like the base software service roll
[08:24] through
[08:26] the crypto kind of wave was rolling
[08:29] through
[08:29] um but we were working together
[08:32] and we were really looking at what how
[08:35] you know how much value could you create
[08:37] in crypto it's not you know it does some
[08:39] things well some things not maybe as
[08:41] well as traditional Technologies and so
[08:43] the value creation part was a little bit
[08:45] of a
[08:46] in our minds but then when we saw gpt3
[08:49] launch it was very clear that you would
[08:52] have infinite amounts of upside from the
[08:54] creativity of text generation
[08:56] so when you ask the question how what's
[08:58] the value of all potential texts that
[09:00] could be written
[09:02] it's like you know it's an infinite it's
[09:05] literally an infinite amount so where
[09:07] you want to be positioned as a company
[09:09] that turns these text generators into
[09:11] real
[09:13] real world use cases that if we could
[09:15] position your company in front of as
[09:17] much of that Tailwind as possible on the
[09:20] AIS like model Improvement side
[09:22] you know you could build a nice little
[09:24] business
[09:25] so we we started we started testing
[09:27] different product hooks to try to figure
[09:28] out what is the right interface for
[09:31] people to use that makes
[09:32] it easy for them to adopt it figure out
[09:34] how to use it and figure it out how much
[09:37] work needs to be done on top of the open
[09:39] AI models to be able to do what you all
[09:42] do because like to me you know when I
[09:44] first saw open a copy.ai I was like oh
[09:48] is this just an interface on top of gpt3
[09:51] or is there some sort of Magic on top of
[09:53] GPT that allows people to get the actual
[09:55] outputs that you're you know promising
[09:57] basically like how much work went into
[09:59] adapting the models to meet the kind of
[10:01] you know strategy of the business
[10:04] I can share a bit about that actually so
[10:07] um when we first started it wasn't too
[10:09] much there was some work that could be
[10:11] done there was like you know
[10:13] understanding and following the latest
[10:15] improvements on how to even talk to the
[10:18] AI models like you know you could have
[10:21] just yeah basically there was some
[10:22] initial improvements at that stage uh
[10:25] since then we've invested heavily into r
[10:27] d and turns out we were barely
[10:30] scratching the surface of what's
[10:31] possible and so today you know we work
[10:34] really closely with openai and we're
[10:35] really excited and there's like certain
[10:37] things that we discover that we can
[10:39] still share with them and it's new to
[10:41] them so you know this is a completely
[10:43] Green Field opportunity for discovering
[10:47] what's possible and it's hilarious
[10:50] because it just takes a little bit of
[10:51] creativity
[10:53] I see like a lot of different companies
[10:56] popping up now too and maybe they're
[10:57] just popping up because they're becoming
[10:58] popular but they have their own models
[11:00] like there's um you know there's a dolly
[11:03] basically competitor that's doing some
[11:04] really interesting stuff are there do
[11:06] you see ourselves leveraging a lot of
[11:08] these Partners do you still see yourself
[11:09] you know creating some of your own
[11:10] models like is it what does the future
[11:13] kind of look like
[11:16] yeah
[11:18] yeah so you have you have like base
[11:20] model providers and base models
[11:23] [Music]
[11:30] in some cases you might say okay it's
[11:32] worth our time to invest money into
[11:34] building our own like totally
[11:36] proprietary models
[11:39] um that would you probably like if that
[11:41] happens is like we're not doing that yet
[11:43] maybe down the road but right now you
[11:45] just need to leverage like the latest
[11:47] and greatest and you want to be
[11:50] be best models
[11:51] so it's it's not like like this whole
[11:54] quality cost trade-off like you really
[11:57] need to go after the quality so we we've
[11:59] worked really close with open AI help
[12:01] s and it's been a great kind of
[12:04] Enterprise partnership with them
[12:07] um what's what's nice you know we we're
[12:10] built in a way that's really agnostic so
[12:11] it doesn't you know we can use another
[12:14] provider's models if if that you know
[12:17] that those are better
[12:18] um but they have very different problems
[12:20] that they need to solve and we have very
[12:22] different problems we need to solve this
[12:23] in
[12:24] them so I don't really see a lot of
[12:26] change in the in that framework
[12:29] um you mentioned Dolly that's like an
[12:31] image generation model there is a lot of
[12:34] yeah there are a lot of different image
[12:36] generation models
[12:38] model here right now so it's gonna be
[12:40] interesting to see how that
[12:42] and you know I saw recently the gpt3 at
[12:46] the cost per you know API caller
[12:48] processing has started to come down it
[12:50] seems like to be pretty deflationary is
[12:52] that is that what you expect over the
[12:53] next you know several years is the cost
[12:55] of compute and like the model
[12:57] utilization is just going to keep going
[12:59] down and down and down
[13:01] so the cost of computing will drop like
[13:04] that's a that's a Moore's law issue
[13:07] and but the uh the actual usage amount
[13:11] will
[13:12] compete with each cycle that you see
[13:14] drop and how do you think about that in
[13:16] the framework of like your business
[13:17] model at all
[13:18] I can share a little bit and I actually
[13:20] want to start with a question how many
[13:22] times do you think AWS have dropped
[13:25] their prices I think I've seen something
[13:26] it's in the hundreds or like they do it
[13:28] like every year like you know 50 100
[13:30] times or something right I mean there's
[13:31] so many people actually since last year
[13:34] it was 107 times since it launched in
[13:37] 2006. like we expect something similar I
[13:41] don't know if it's gonna be that drastic
[13:42] but on our end you know Moore's Law is
[13:45] on the right side here um I was
[13:46] listening to a podcast I think it was
[13:48] the all-in podcast and they were saying
[13:49] that what people haven't realized is
[13:51] that Morris law hasn't ended it just
[13:54] shifted to gpus
[13:56] um and you know so now we are really
[13:58] benefiting from those laws and then the
[14:01] latest research
[14:03] um that has come out I think from Google
[14:05] uh basically stated oh you actually
[14:07] don't need more computation power you
[14:10] just need more data and that means that
[14:13] oh you get really really good models
[14:15] without having to have ridiculous
[14:17] hardware and even one of the dolly
[14:21] competitors according to Twitter was
[14:24] trained for about six hundred thousand
[14:25] dollars which is like insane
[14:35] you've both talked about Vision you know
[14:37] Paul you said it when you first got on
[14:39] Chris I saw you had a LinkedIn post
[14:40] about how important long-term vision is
[14:42] you're you're in a space that's very
[14:44] kind of open-ended you know you focus in
[14:47] right now on copy generation even that
[14:49] is a big opportunity
[14:51] um you know I just saw I don't know if
[14:52] you saw a depth it's like act-1 and
[14:56] basically text prompts can actually you
[14:58] know provide take action in multiple
[15:00] different you know online platforms and
[15:02] do your work for you and stuff like what
[15:04] are the bounds of your vision like where
[15:06] does this go over the next five to ten
[15:08] years what problem do you guys
[15:09] specifically solve versus what the rest
[15:11] of the world of AI is going to solve
[15:18] um it's fascinating right Adept their
[15:21] action Transformer great stuff the speed
[15:24] of this industry is going crazy but you
[15:27] can explain what it what that demo
[15:28] showcase yeah I could do a quick demo of
[15:30] that uh basically they uh from what I
[15:33] understand trained a massive model on a
[15:36] lot of specific data
[15:39] oh no uh specifically for
[15:42] um doing actions on a browser so the
[15:46] demo that they released shows them on
[15:48] Redfin and they type hey give me houses
[15:51] in Houston that are under 600k and I
[15:55] have a family of four and basically
[15:57] Adept new which boxes to click which
[16:00] buttons to click what to type into the
[16:02] boxes to fit your search for this
[16:06] interface and that's like mind-blowing
[16:08] stuff right uh Paul and I like to
[16:11] approach this problem in particular from
[16:13] a where should the world be in 10 years
[16:17] what's not going to change versus
[16:21] yeah I guess it's a working backwards
[16:23] thing uh we definitely got that mental
[16:25] model from Jeff Bezos
[16:27] um but for us it's like okay what is the
[16:31] future you don't want to build and what
[16:32] is the future you do want to build and
[16:34] in Paul in my eye it's like wait we want
[16:37] to make sure the future is human-centric
[16:39] if it's not human-centric it is a scary
[16:42] scary future but then how do you really
[16:45] resolve this conflict that these AI
[16:48] models are getting so good you know like
[16:50] businesses are going to start reducing
[16:52] head count right they're gonna tell us
[16:54] to try their best to reduce as much as
[16:56] possible just from a pure economic
[16:58] standpoint and then the realization was
[17:01] okay well if that's true then it means
[17:04] the corollary is true we need to build
[17:06] the best human tools that allows anybody
[17:09] to be able to launch their own business
[17:11] to be able to accomplish their own goals
[17:13] at a really high rate at an extremely
[17:16] high level
[17:18] and so we have an unofficial vision of a
[17:20] billion new entrepreneurs over the next
[17:22] decade right what would it take what's
[17:25] the platform that needs to get built for
[17:27] that to
[17:28] happen globally and that would be the
[17:30] true entrepreneurial explosion right
[17:33] there needs to be there there are going
[17:35] to be societal shifts there's going to
[17:37] be massive things that will need to
[17:40] change and we want to build the tools
[17:42] that keep it human-centric that keep it
[17:45] so that there is not going to be a huge
[17:47] wealth inequality instead it's going to
[17:49] be almost like the world's greatest like
[17:51] meritocracy in a way where it's like you
[17:54] know the best ideas will come to life
[17:56] they will go more viral they will work
[17:58] and then people will just constantly be
[18:00] able to express their ideas
[18:02] another way of framing this
[18:04] um is you know given a 10 chance of
[18:08] success how many times do you have to
[18:11] try to like start a company before you
[18:14] have like a 90 some percent chance of
[18:16] success across the board
[18:18] I forgot the exact number but it's like
[18:20] high it's like 30 times there's
[18:22] something along those lines
[18:24] um and so it's like okay well then
[18:25] there's two ways of attacking this
[18:27] problem one is to just try more and it's
[18:32] a try more that means you need to be
[18:33] able to increase your velocity of
[18:36] testing right and then the second one is
[18:39] to increase your chances and probability
[18:41] of success per try and if you can do
[18:45] both then you can turn like any idea
[18:47] into some sort of reality that can
[18:50] potentially work as a standalone
[18:52] business you know with as little time
[18:54] and effort as necessary and it's just
[18:56] the true exercise of your creativity
[18:59] right you have an idea it's like
[19:01] wouldn't it be cool if and then it can
[19:04] become reality we can try one of those
[19:06] yeah you try one of those Michael which
[19:08] one
[19:09] Michael how
[19:12] have you ever wanted to own an island
[19:14] have I ever wanted to own one yeah yeah
[19:17] why not
[19:18] seems like a fun thing Richard Branson
[19:20] that's fine how does
[19:21] exactly how does the Earth make Islands
[19:24] I guess it's you know matter coming out
[19:27] from underneath and you know it hardens
[19:29] into rock formations and it keeps
[19:31] pushing itself up volcanoes right okay
[19:37] if you wanted to build your own Island
[19:40] you would need
[19:42] to use volcanoes and pipe lava from a
[19:46] volcano
[19:48] yeah right 100
[19:50] that's just an engineering problem
[19:52] but somebody's got to own the the land
[19:54] too but yeah
[19:56] I mean if you're in the middle of the
[19:57] ocean you know you just said can you
[19:59] just claim that land offer free grabs
[20:02] yeah
[20:04] yeah damn that's interesting right so
[20:08] that's an idea Elon Musk be like
[20:09] somebody should you know create Islands
[20:12] out of lava like I'm gonna do it you
[20:13] know and then everybody wants to invest
[20:16] in his company's worth a billion dollars
[20:18] the next day right 100 percent
[20:20] and then you have to break you break
[20:22] down the engineering task and you're
[20:23] saying okay well what does it actually
[20:24] take do I need to sell something on the
[20:26] front end to actually find this business
[20:28] can I fundraise like what is it so when
[20:31] musk says okay I'm gonna need tunnels on
[20:34] Mars because we're gonna need an
[20:35] underground you know civilization
[20:37] let's let's test that out you know on
[20:41] Earth and if I'm gonna do it what's the
[20:43] bottleneck to actually doing it really
[20:45] cheaply and that's usually the
[20:46] bottleneck to every kind of kind of real
[20:48] world thing
[20:49] so as it turns out it's just the machine
[20:51] is not very efficient
[20:53] and so his engineering tasks just make a
[20:55] more efficient like tone machine
[20:58] right just look at that problem break it
[21:00] down from first principles and rebuild
[21:02] it from the ground up and get you know a
[21:04] 10x savings
[21:06] um so even that strategy of like how do
[21:09] you actually approach a problem and how
[21:10] do you actually build a solution
[21:12] people are not good at that
[21:15] and so if even if you wanted to do it if
[21:18] you have the wrong approach you're going
[21:19] to spend
[21:20] if you're in
[21:26] like the thing that you want to do and
[21:28] then you end up failing at it
[21:30] so I can't I can't tell you how many
[21:31] Founders are out there they just fail
[21:33] like constantly
[21:36] just constantly you know maybe they fell
[21:37] once maybe they fell twice but it you
[21:40] know if you ask them well what was the
[21:41] how did you approach the problem how did
[21:43] you think about what you would do first
[21:45] and sequence it if that's wrong you're
[21:47] just setting yourself up for failure so
[21:50] so if you're if you're trying to like
[21:52] Empower you know a billion entrepreneurs
[21:54] in the next 10 20 50 years dude and you
[21:57] break it down into first principles does
[21:59] it does it somehow start with copy
[22:01] generation and AI like how did how does
[22:03] it why is that the starting point
[22:06] it's a good plan right what's your plan
[22:08] hey did you think through do you have
[22:11] like your key assumptions laid out are
[22:13] they good assumptions to make
[22:15] right if I'm gonna if I'm let's say
[22:16] we're gonna start this island company
[22:19] where you start first well you might
[22:21] want like a website that explains the
[22:23] project right and you might use like
[22:26] Dolly to generate an image of some some
[22:29] volcano factories in the middle of the
[22:31] ocean
[22:32] yeah you know you know in old days
[22:34] either to find someone to do like
[22:35] concept art but it was like kind of
[22:37] hokey right it was like an illustration
[22:39] but now you can literally generate
[22:40] unlimited shot
[22:43] until you find something that actually
[22:45] really compelling to people is it
[22:46] interesting that the prompt creativity
[22:48] becomes the new kind of creativity you
[22:50] know it's like if the creativity is just
[22:51] shifted
[22:53] it's still text yeah
[22:57] yeah
[22:58] um it is so so now
[23:00] with with the image generation side
[23:02] that's gone so I can just I could show
[23:04] you like 10 renders and you'd be like oh
[23:06] my God like I can the vision you know
[23:09] vision is a very it's a visual thing and
[23:12] how you communicate if I communicate in
[23:13] words you're like Ah that's kind of
[23:15] interesting but what's in your head is
[23:17] not what's in my head and so the purpose
[23:19] of these renders is actually to make it
[23:21] very a lot more concrete for you
[23:24] and a big component that I really did
[23:27] not appreciate especially on the text
[23:29] generation side
[23:31] um was if you have a dumb idea
[23:35] and then you write out a plan
[23:38] it actually makes it not as dumb at all
[23:41] and your the idea had some nugget of
[23:44] something that's interesting enough for
[23:46] you to like think about it and want to
[23:48] express it but when you actually build a
[23:49] plan you can make the idea great
[23:51] so I did this test on Twitter I asked
[23:54] people to
[23:55] reply with like a dumb idea and then I
[23:57] use our tools to like
[23:58] actually create a viable business around
[24:01] like a viable business plan around what
[24:03] they were talking about
[24:06] and then they you'd see it it's like
[24:08] okay
[24:09] the thing that was in my head this
[24:11] creativity got trapped because I could
[24:13] not express it
[24:14] I could not express it to other people
[24:16] and I could not express it to myself
[24:18] and that barrier
[24:20] is this you know I see a lot of uh
[24:24] similarities between adults not being as
[24:27] creative as kids when it comes to like
[24:29] painting artwork
[24:31] um just imagination storytelling like
[24:34] kids are really amazing at that
[24:36] and then at some point you just stop
[24:37] being creative I don't know if it's
[24:39] because school like pounds that out of
[24:41] you because you're penalized for being
[24:43] created numbed by the world right answer
[24:45] are you getting numb exactly you got
[24:47] Numb by the world you got slapped down
[24:49] you know
[24:51] people
[24:54] [Music]
[24:58] like in the workforce if if you have a
[25:01] role and you you go create something new
[25:03] you improve a process you do something
[25:04] that wasn't asked
[25:07] you get rewarded all day long for that
[25:11] and on the like at the most creative
[25:15] like the most creation
[25:17] or creative potential that you have is
[25:19] when you find something you're really
[25:21] passionate about where you can express
[25:23] that creativity and
[25:26] paper productive behind
[25:29] behind this is the point that that Chris
[25:32] mentioned around a billion entrepreneurs
[25:34] like
[25:35] not only are people going to be able to
[25:37] create things easier but they're going
[25:39] to be able to create more things that
[25:40] they want to create
[25:41] and they'll spend less time
[25:44] um doing the stuff that they don't you
[25:46] know they didn't want to do or you
[25:47] didn't know how to do and you'll be able
[25:48] to get those ideas out there much faster
[25:50] and have you have you found that the
[25:52] models help you unlock stuff that's
[25:55] stuck in your brain that you can't
[25:56] articulate you're saying okay I have
[25:58] this really big Vision but I can't
[26:00] really articulate it well here's some of
[26:02] my thoughts around it and AI can help
[26:04] draw that out and amplify it
[26:07] yeah and we have we have a new product
[26:10] feature we're building now that's gonna
[26:12] put that on steroids and
[26:14] what are the bounds of like these types
[26:15] of things if I said hey here's all the
[26:17] parameters of my business where this or
[26:19] that where this swag up does this this
[26:21] is our business model can you provide me
[26:23] things that we should be doing
[26:25] strategies that we should be building
[26:26] out you know you can yeah it'll suggest
[26:29] it can suggest all that stuff for you
[26:31] and does that at a point does that
[26:33] become commoditized because everybody
[26:35] has access to these same models or can
[26:38] you find kind of a differentiation and
[26:40] opportunity
[26:41] yeah the differentiation is like what
[26:44] it's it's where you want to take your
[26:46] product and where you think value can be
[26:48] created
[26:49] so there are many businesses where the
[26:51] model is very standard you end up with
[26:53] multiple companies
[26:55] right and then somebody will Niche down
[26:57] and differentiate over here
[27:01] the better way to frame it is like who
[27:03] has
[27:05] who has the most compelling Vision to
[27:07] unlock the most value
[27:09] and if you do that then each thing you
[27:11] build unlocks more value and that's
[27:13] really the secret of
[27:16] um Road mapping and exploration because
[27:19] this whole area is brand new
[27:21] so so like you said you know you need
[27:24] maybe you want somebody to brainstorm
[27:26] with that has infinite knowledge and
[27:27] infinite wisdom
[27:29] of business models
[27:31] person
[27:32] like it would be
[27:34] you know be a computer that already has
[27:36] you know this train on all this a lot of
[27:38] this information that's probably and do
[27:40] you find that you guys fit that you know
[27:43] that Gap like that's where you want to
[27:44] continue to spend time like I feel like
[27:46] copy you know that's a byproduct that is
[27:48] not like our core like how we make money
[27:51] today but that's actually a byproduct
[27:54] the technology that we're building how
[27:56] do you feel about positioning because
[27:58] you know obviously when you build a
[27:59] business from zero to one you know
[28:00] niching down going after a specific
[28:02] problem people know what you do I mean
[28:04] that's what allows you to get so many
[28:05] customers so quickly but it's also
[28:07] limiting in a way if I copy.ai doesn't
[28:09] fully encapsulate what your vision is
[28:12] and where you're trying to go do you do
[28:13] you find that to be a challenge this is
[28:15] just a natural progression where the
[28:16] company's going to evolve
[28:18] yeah I mean every every company evolves
[28:20] and does more than where they start
[28:22] yeah we have a pretty simple
[28:24] um product heuristic I guess for this
[28:27] which is
[28:29] build really cool stuff
[28:31] demos take care of itself right like you
[28:35] just show what's possible you just show
[28:37] it off in the demo it has to be simple
[28:39] to use easy to understand and then you
[28:42] know people will want to sign up they'll
[28:44] want to sign up and adverse software is
[28:46] set up where they don't need to watch
[28:48] the training they don't need to read
[28:50] documentation and they can use it and
[28:53] get value out of it that's the ultimate
[28:56] um you know filing
[28:59] yeah we've learned a lot from Google
[29:00] their search you know interface is a
[29:04] text box and then search button it's
[29:06] like great right right it's like 80 of
[29:08] their revenue right
[29:10] yeah
[29:11] yeah and that's that's how like they
[29:13] built their platform off of that and
[29:15] it's worked really well for them so I
[29:17] think you know as as our product matures
[29:19] you're gonna see more of that platform
[29:21] effect take hold
[29:23] um across the board there's
[29:25] there's we get a lot of questions about
[29:27] like what's your mode this that I'm like
[29:29] well there are a lot of modes that you
[29:31] build on every time you do something
[29:34] um a great mode is
[29:36] having customers that's an awesome note
[29:39] um having for us like we're really very
[29:42] focused on Distributing the product as
[29:44] widely and as globally as possible
[29:47] that's also re that it reinforces the
[29:53] quality of AI models where the more
[29:55] diverse your training set is
[29:58] both in terms of use case and user like
[30:02] like let's say
[30:04] professionals amateurs like students
[30:07] whatever
[30:08] the more variety you get in your dreams
[30:10] and the benefits of that are mostly
[30:11] occurring to you all or to open AI as
[30:14] well
[30:15] yeah open AI has they have a different
[30:18] piece that they're optimizing for but a
[30:21] lot of this all this training data set
[30:23] that comes to us and we use that to find
[30:27] teams so we we improve on their models
[30:29] for our use cases gotcha from Mike you
[30:31] know you talk about getting into hands
[30:32] as many people as possible do you see
[30:34] kind of a platform orientation for you
[30:36] all in the future where it's very kind
[30:38] of api-centric embedded throughout
[30:40] products across the internet and other
[30:42] people are leveraging your models to you
[30:45] know let's say I'm a book publisher and
[30:46] I want open ai's models like natively in
[30:49] there so entrepreneurs can start book
[30:51] companies like are you going to help
[30:52] them start the book company or is it
[30:54] through apis where you guys are powering
[30:55] those you know experiences that are more
[30:57] niched down to specific you know
[30:59] business models
[31:00] yeah we're we're not we don't have any
[31:03] apis right now apis are they're
[31:05] interesting
[31:06] so we're intrigued but that's not our
[31:08] current business model we have a lot of
[31:10] work to do on the product just the core
[31:12] product first before you get into like
[31:15] real
[31:16] API play yep it makes sense I think yo
[31:20] and it's not it's not right now it's not
[31:22] that easy for like
[31:26] if you're gonna go do an API that's
[31:28] gonna be more of an Enterprise kind of
[31:31] position can a billion people in the
[31:33] world use an API and that take another
[31:35] way of thinking about it that's a great
[31:37] question not maybe you know to me apis
[31:40] are one to many things I mean they're
[31:41] leveraged almost in a B2B sense of like
[31:43] hey I'm going to enable my users to get
[31:46] power from this capability but I'm not
[31:47] going to expose the API to them you know
[31:49] they're just you know leveraging the
[31:51] capabilities of it
[31:52] um but yeah yeah we haven't we have one
[31:55] more assumption which is most pretty
[31:57] much every product will adopt
[32:01] part of the product and we're thinking
[32:03] about it you know how can we automate
[32:05] product mock-ups in real time leveraging
[32:07] Ai and you know image processing based
[32:10] on prompts that people are providing
[32:11] like hey I want to see the copy.a logo
[32:14] you know repeating in a really modern
[32:16] pattern on this box you'll show me that
[32:19] right now you know that I think there's
[32:20] a lot of opportunity just in our
[32:21] business for that but you know that's
[32:22] just one random use case
[32:24] you know and we're paying tens of
[32:26] thousands of dollars a month for design
[32:28] fees for our team you know what happens
[32:30] if the product if the experience becomes
[32:32] instantaneous for the customer and we
[32:34] eliminate that cost it's a it's a
[32:36] win-win for everybody across the board
[32:38] yeah
[32:39] except for the designers yeah or they
[32:41] can become prompt writers or something I
[32:43] don't know I think Chris's point about
[32:44] the abundance of AI is you know could
[32:47] potentially rise the top you know the
[32:48] boats of everybody involved you know if
[32:50] you're an individual designer maybe you
[32:52] can build a massive business on top of
[32:54] these capabilities versus employing a
[32:56] bunch of designers and having a service
[32:57] business or something so
[33:00] I think the abundance and growth
[33:02] ultimately is is really good for people
[33:05] in general for health and the wellness
[33:07] of a country and you know poverty and
[33:09] all these different things especially
[33:11] when you have a declining age of
[33:12] population you know like everybody talks
[33:14] about how you know any crazy even
[33:17] increasing age yeah yeah increasing age
[33:20] but I mean um yeah I mean less babies
[33:21] are being had you know we're going to
[33:23] see a population decline in general but
[33:25] doesn't AI maybe have not if Elon Musk
[33:28] has anything to do with that yeah his
[33:30] family tree is just single-handedly
[33:32] repopulating but don't but don't you
[33:34] feel that AI has the inverse effect of
[33:37] population decline because it also
[33:40] creates just like Leverage for the the
[33:42] lower amount of people that you do have
[33:45] I don't know so productivity and
[33:47] leverage that kind of made sense to me
[33:49] if you think about humans
[33:52] but I hardly disagree on that why is
[33:56] that
[33:57] population is is different population is
[34:01] like
[34:03] the function of the you know people's
[34:05] optimism about the future and if they
[34:07] think there's gonna be more abundance
[34:08] and if they think they can afford the
[34:10] lifestyle they went today so you know AI
[34:13] may maybe will improve the lifestyle
[34:15] people have today
[34:18] but it it's I'm you know it's unclear
[34:21] how but people talk about how population
[34:23] decline you know decreases aggregate
[34:25] demand decreases growth rates but don't
[34:27] you think that AI could have the inverse
[34:29] impact or at least offset some of the
[34:31] you know the lack of productivity and
[34:33] growth and demand a lot of the well the
[34:36] yeah the issue is that if you look at
[34:38] let's just take like the AI stuff we're
[34:40] doing
[34:41] that can improve productivity of like
[34:44] white collar office work
[34:47] but so much of the economies are
[34:50] Services based where you have like
[34:51] teachers and nurses and that is never
[34:55] going to increase their productivity in
[34:57] any meaningful because it's human to
[34:59] Human
[35:00] um work and so when you look at the
[35:02] entire like
[35:04] you break down the entire GDP of
[35:06] economies it's
[35:09] it's not gonna like I know some people
[35:10] on Twitter predicting like 20 GDP you
[35:13] know but we don't even have enough
[35:14] teachers and we don't have standardized
[35:16] education what if AI comes in and
[35:18] teaches at the highest levels you know
[35:20] to the students of the world and drives
[35:22] you know education you know at a much
[35:24] more equal level
[35:27] someone's gotta watch your kids Michael
[35:29] not really I mean people were home you
[35:32] know doing homeschooling while their
[35:33] parents were working in the other room
[35:35] not even paying attention to them so who
[35:37] knows
[35:38] I don't know how much the kids learned I
[35:40] wanted to find out but according to
[35:42] every standardized yeah they're down
[35:44] like 20 30 percent from and according to
[35:46] IQ test scores you're you're having huge
[35:49] drops and that has massive knock-on
[35:52] effects because you can't just like
[35:55] you can't just make that up you can't
[35:57] make up what was lost so I think we
[35:59] definitely need more tooling around that
[36:01] but no uh that that's a disaster so a
[36:06] bit faster we can go on for Forever on
[36:08] that that's like more of a joke Joe
[36:09] Rogan podcast type of conversation
[36:12] um but you know as a user of of your
[36:14] platform especially like when it was
[36:16] first starting it seemed like
[36:16] gamification it was one of the biggest
[36:19] reasons that it kind of took off so
[36:21] quickly because for me I was like [ __ ] I
[36:22] just want to download this and use it
[36:24] because I'm not even downloaded but just
[36:26] use it because it's just fun it's like a
[36:28] game I'm gonna go in I'm gonna type [ __ ]
[36:30] the same thing on Dolly I'm typing stuff
[36:31] I'm sharing it how much was that like
[36:34] helpful in terms of acquiring customers
[36:36] and getting them kind of bought in first
[36:38] and then you know how do you then take
[36:39] that you know light interest and turn it
[36:42] into like hey actual paying customers I
[36:43] know you've done a lot of like free
[36:45] trials like Hey we're free on the
[36:46] weekend like come in you really push on
[36:48] that as a strategy
[36:50] uh weird we have a totally free plan now
[36:53] so
[36:58] every single month
[37:00] and so like that caught that helped like
[37:02] kind of promote the product as well
[37:04] there's a big aha moment when he used
[37:06] generative AI
[37:08] oh I can I can actually expand
[37:12] and know something about what I'm trying
[37:14] that it's an aha moment that's like a
[37:17] mental shift for our users and that's
[37:19] that's like a huge
[37:21] a huge aha moment like one of the best
[37:24] in the business dolly is great too you
[37:26] know you have some idea in your head you
[37:27] type it in there's an image the LinkedIn
[37:30] [ __ ] posting uh generator
[37:33] that was great great just like it's yeah
[37:36] the the [ __ ] that's generator solid
[37:38] stuff right
[37:40] like viral viral post generator
[37:43] um but the problem is
[37:45] you know how how much of how much value
[37:47] can you create off an image for you know
[37:49] how much value you can create off text
[37:51] and then is that a frequent you know
[37:53] repeatable need that you have in your
[37:55] day-to-day
[37:58] um for for some people that are writing
[38:00] a lot yeah that's like a big need and
[38:01] then
[38:02] a lot of other people know it's not so
[38:04] they'll come in and test it out but but
[38:06] maybe that
[38:08] at any given time yeah so it's really
[38:10] our job yeah exactly yeah it's our job
[38:13] to actually increase the value to all
[38:16] users
[38:18] and then long term especially the long
[38:20] tail
[38:23] writing or creating anything on a
[38:25] day-to-day basis
[38:27] Chris Chris are you gonna say something
[38:30] no I just I added yet
[38:32] people are going to be writing a lot
[38:34] more I think people don't write as much
[38:36] because it's just hard to express
[38:38] yourself and when people start learning
[38:40] wow it's actually really easy to express
[38:42] myself if I can just put down raw
[38:44] thoughts and get out it really coherent
[38:46] post that is exactly what I'm trying to
[38:48] say you know that you will share a lot
[38:51] of knowledge it makes it a lot easier to
[38:52] share knowledge it makes it a lot easier
[38:54] to you know share your experience it's
[38:57] just in that unlocks a lot more of the
[38:59] internet the power of the internet for
[39:01] the people that shift to like a paid
[39:02] plan and it's like not like hey I'm just
[39:04] [ __ ] around with this tool because
[39:05] it's fun what are the what are the use
[39:07] cases like what are the major things
[39:08] that they're doing to you know build
[39:10] their business make money you know
[39:12] provide value and impact like what are
[39:14] the most sticky use cases
[39:16] yeah so it's a lot of organic marketing
[39:19] for your business so
[39:23] you know you have you're selling some
[39:24] product online maybe you want Google you
[39:26] know rank higher on Google right so you
[39:28] need to put up a blog posts you need you
[39:31] know content that Google will lift up
[39:33] the rankings so it's like one use case
[39:36] web pages a lot of companies don't even
[39:38] have a web page on their site that
[39:40] explains all their products
[39:43] um so that's that's really easy
[39:46] people use these are tools like our
[39:48] freestyle tool to write emails so all
[39:50] you have to do is just describe like
[39:52] who's this email to what do you need to
[39:54] cover and then you click generate and
[39:56] you get like a completed email out of
[39:59] the end of it that sounds great and
[40:00] you're like oh this is awesome I don't
[40:02] have to spend any time writing that I
[40:04] could just just send it and like it's
[40:07] it's this an amazing enablement thing
[40:09] for human communication like
[40:14] so those are like the the main ones
[40:16] right now we have a lot of um people
[40:18] that
[40:19] do need help like rewriting things maybe
[40:22] like social media posts uh that they
[40:25] need like Instagram captions for
[40:26] if they want like to like build out like
[40:28] a kind of
[40:30] kind of better is it mostly individuals
[40:31] is it teams and companies
[40:35] yeah we have we have a mix of both
[40:37] um because we're freemium we have a lot
[40:39] of individuals um
[40:42] writing is often like a very individual
[40:45] thing that they're doing and then we
[40:47] also have a collaborative functionality
[40:48] as well like we're on a team
[40:51] um
[40:52] like for edit company I think one of the
[40:54] things too with writing is just like
[40:55] it's so hard to get from off the
[40:57] starting block you know like you have
[40:58] that writer's block and and you know in
[41:01] a way you know maybe you don't use the
[41:03] exact prompt but you use it as like a
[41:04] starting point to figure out what should
[41:07] I be thinking about what should I be
[41:08] writing and kind of unblock people and
[41:10] unblock that creativity do you see
[41:12] people kind of leveraging it that way
[41:13] too is like a catalyst
[41:17] uh yes yeah so it it does zero to one
[41:20] writing way better than it does like
[41:25] so you really it is a
[41:28] that's where the the products really
[41:30] shine
[41:31] it makes sense and then what about you
[41:33] know inputting external data sources you
[41:35] know if I'm writing copy for my website
[41:37] or for my ad copy or whatever you know
[41:39] there's external data sources that say
[41:41] disperformed better than than something
[41:43] else is that something that the you know
[41:45] the operator kind of has to just come
[41:46] back and and make tweaks based on what
[41:48] they're seeing or do you do you see
[41:50] foresee kind of bringing in external
[41:51] data to make it more you know powerful
[41:54] and impactful for that user
[41:56] yeah over time we'll see you'll see that
[41:58] yeah
[41:59] for sure makes sense what about you know
[42:01] the next like I also thought Facebook
[42:04] would do that
[42:06] and they have it I thought Google would
[42:08] do that as a feature but they haven't so
[42:10] I don't know what what's taking there's
[42:12] probably like three Google teams working
[42:14] on it and they all don't know that each
[42:15] other's working on it I don't know
[42:17] when it's so we're we're two years out
[42:21] if we over two years out we still have
[42:23] no feature that helps you like but
[42:25] they're probably having a meeting about
[42:26] it probably at Google and then they're
[42:29] gonna meet about it next month to think
[42:30] if they should I don't know it's it's a
[42:32] people yeah people keep asking
[42:34] I'm just I don't know I thought they'd
[42:37] do it I don't know what to tell you
[42:39] it's so core of their business that's
[42:41] literally how they make
[42:46] yeah I'm at a loss I can't they should
[42:49] just pay you guys like 10 million
[42:50] dollars to figure it out for them
[42:57] care about optimizing ads yeah that's
[43:00] that badly sense well you know looking
[43:02] ahead like kind of like the economic
[43:04] environment that we're in as an
[43:05] entrepreneur do you look do you guys
[43:07] look at what's going on externally in
[43:09] the funding environments and the you
[43:11] know Equity markets does it matter at
[43:13] all to your execution on a daily basis
[43:14] if if your employees care about those
[43:16] things or stock valuations and employee
[43:19] stock options is that is that stuff that
[43:21] you kind of have in the back of your
[43:22] mind as you're operating or do you have
[43:23] to kind of just drown out the noise and
[43:25] just you know stay focused
[43:27] dude we thought we were in a tech bubble
[43:29] when we left our jobs and started a
[43:32] company so we thought the good times
[43:34] were going to end
[43:35] almost immediately I think everybody
[43:37] thought that for so long you know it was
[43:39] like a house of cards just waiting to
[43:40] collapse for two three yeah so we've
[43:43] we've kept the team super lean we're
[43:45] we're 26 people we're at 9.1 million in
[43:48] ARR like that's way that's probably it's
[43:50] like almost 500 000 per person in the
[43:54] revenue per employee like it's it's
[43:56] Stout so we've been really disciplined
[43:59] we've burned you know less than one
[44:01] times our ARR since Inception so
[44:03] we care a lot about Capital efficiency
[44:06] and the whole point of AI is that it
[44:09] should make companies more efficient so
[44:10] I'm not sure how companies can bloat up
[44:14] adopt AI like natively it's it's really
[44:17] unfathomable so a lot of the
[44:19] talent that got brought onto teams
[44:23] like a lot of teams across the Venture
[44:25] like startup landscape
[44:28] they were unable to unlock
[44:30] like the 10x value from those
[44:32] Investments and a lot of those folks
[44:34] unfortunately had you know gotten laid
[44:36] off some people
[44:37] now are sensing more layoffs that are
[44:40] like secondly off at their layoff and so
[44:42] it's it's really a crazy time to be
[44:47] so yeah it's something we've thought
[44:48] about a lot
[44:50] um
[44:51] I you know I think the funding Market
[44:53] was probably we'll probably turn around
[44:55] some but
[44:57] you should always operate your business
[44:59] like
[45:00] with some discipline
[45:02] I was gonna say it doesn't seem like
[45:04] it's had to have been like a big shift
[45:06] for you all because you kind of went
[45:07] into it with that mentality already does
[45:10] that come from the time you know
[45:12] observing all those other startups and
[45:14] how they're running them how they're
[45:15] spending money
[45:16] um and also kind of the financial
[45:17] background that you have as well no my
[45:20] uh
[45:21] I lost a lot of money in the first tech
[45:23] bubble when I was in Middle School day
[45:24] trading stocks Middle School nice you're
[45:26] calling your broker at lunch or
[45:28] something
[45:30] you trade so
[45:33] we made all this money like buying all
[45:34] these stocks stock like AOL
[45:37] so you have the scar tissue
[45:40] dude I got layers of it layers of it so
[45:42] that okay why does it account
[45:47] uh got a degree in economics and
[45:48] accounting
[45:49] started my career in accounting then it
[45:51] was like cool I understand if I had to
[45:53] read a financial statement but I don't
[45:55] know what value is so I went into the
[45:57] head
[45:58] industry
[45:59] learn about value investing and growth
[46:01] investing and then I was like cool I
[46:03] understand
[46:03] what increases the value of a company
[46:05] and you know what it is Michael what
[46:07] free cash flow sales sales sales sales
[46:11] is the output of more sales right yes so
[46:15] the question is well how do you grow
[46:16] sales talk to a CPA they have no idea
[46:20] talk to a financial analyst
[46:22] at an investment Bank how do you grow
[46:24] sales they don't know
[46:26] and those are the people that manage and
[46:29] run a lot of companies especially big
[46:31] ones and they have no idea how to grow
[46:33] how do you grow
[46:36] it comes out of the like you need a
[46:39] great product that's adding value and
[46:40] then you Market the [ __ ] out of it
[46:42] it's easier said than done right
[46:46] yeah but you actually have to learn how
[46:48] to do it and you got to try it and um
[46:51] uh no amount of book reading can get you
[46:53] there well no amount of marketing too
[46:54] can can Market you know [ __ ] product to
[46:57] scale no I just disagree with that there
[46:59] are a lot of shitty products that have
[47:01] been marketed well are they marketed
[47:02] well or do they just have like
[47:03] distribution and lock-in
[47:07] that's valuable too right if you're
[47:09] building it that's pretty valuable too
[47:10] like Microsoft teams being like five to
[47:13] ten times bigger than stock is it's
[47:15] definitely not the better product
[47:17] that's a whole separate yeah the better
[47:20] product is the one that's available that
[47:22] is actually
[47:28] no I don't know
[47:32] um can you just continue this with Paul
[47:34] I got it right all good what we have we
[47:38] have jobs Michael we all got jobs we all
[47:40] got jobs
[47:42] last question for you if if you're if
[47:44] you were talking to another startup
[47:46] founder that came up to you and said hey
[47:47] you know Paul and Chris you know I made
[47:49] a lot of bad decisions I over hired you
[47:51] know we spent too much money we're
[47:52] running out you know I don't know if my
[47:54] customers love the product whatever it
[47:55] might be and now they're facing like
[47:57] excellent existential threat yeah what
[48:00] would be your you know words of wisdom
[48:01] for them about to navigate the next you
[48:03] know few weeks and months and and get to
[48:05] the end of the year they have money left
[48:07] or what kind of situation they have they
[48:09] have like one one month of one to two
[48:11] months of Runway
[48:13] but they have a business that generates
[48:14] Revenue
[48:24] [Music]
[48:26] um a month left that's not much
[48:29] you're gonna have to like at least like
[48:31] you're gonna have to let your team go
[48:32] and give them
[48:35] I mean there's a lot of companies in
[48:36] that position right now they just you
[48:38] know they don't make it public but
[48:40] there's a lot of these types of comments
[48:41] clock yeah the clock ran out that's
[48:43] that's what we all sign up for there is
[48:45] a death rate to this this stuff
[48:48] yeah like the great thing about startups
[48:51] though is everybody's adaptable like if
[48:53] you have skills that you've worked on
[48:54] and built over time
[48:56] you can apply those skills at another
[48:57] company if you're a Founder you know in
[49:00] it's easier to raise money for your next
[49:02] thing I would encourage everybody to
[49:04] train big don't give up hope on like
[49:06] really big Ideas it's way easier to
[49:08] fundraise for that those big Ideas it's
[49:10] way easier to hire Talent
[49:12] to get um you know customers interested
[49:15] in what you're doing if it's a big
[49:19] and I I think that
[49:21] yeah my my main takeaway is
[49:23] we had Mark Andreessen say it's time to
[49:25] build and then I'm looking out here you
[49:28] know two years later
[49:29] and no one's built like the
[49:32] volcano piping Islands into existence
[49:35] yeah all this free money and all we did
[49:36] was build a bunch of nfts
[49:41] pretty disappointing points on everyone
[49:45] so we can't just sit back and like make
[49:47] fun of other people like literally if
[49:50] you had a better idea you know you got
[49:53] to go pursue that so I'd say keep
[49:55] dreaming big and make it like the more
[49:57] ambitious the Bolder you make it the
[49:58] more
[50:00] sweet awesome well when they're tons of
[50:03] fun thanks for coming on

## Full Text (No Timestamps)

[Music] thank you [Music] all right awesome well welcome back to the Out of the Woods podcast it's the first time that we've had three people or two guests but three people total so this is going to be either a [ __ ] show or pretty amazing and fun so we'll figure it out we'll probably talk over each other a few different times uh we have Chris Liu and Paul Jacobian I think I think I said it right he just told me and I probably still mess it up yeah that's close enough that's enough from copy.ai um also been following the journey on Twitter for for a while you're very big on the build in public ethos why do you why do you share everything on Twitter what's the what's the idea there well we uh you know Elon Musk does it and it worked really well for him so we thought we'd like causation or correlation for Elon he shared his vision for everything he does and when you share the vision that's how you actually motivate people for like like assess whether anyone thinks it's Andrew whether anyone's gonna want to work so you end up with this insane growth flywheel that helps you get any I any dumb idea any idea at all really off the ground very quickly and you get traction and he's done it over and over and over again and that's what so is the copy AI Vision interesting enough to get that same result it's a little bit of like what the mission is a little bit harder when you're starting out with like self-service SAS to like have that same level of excitement around the vision um but I think in general like even um I think AI is continuing to get more impressive and I think that that that's where you're going to get a lot of the excitement and just in terms of the Raw practical uh yeah usefulness of the Technologies that's where we're building I think I think like Dolly has kind of been a bit of a Tipping Point because it's so visual like everyone finally sees like oh my gosh like AI is finally getting to a point where it's really useful and interesting whereas you know we've talked about AI for so long do you feel kind of the same way that like the you were at a Tipping Point where it's starting to become kind of a mass Market thing that people realize is like here now uh yeah we've we've hit that moment um first first time was with IBM Watson and IBM's like hey it can do Jeopardy room better than these contestants it was like a very negative way of like a very pessimistic view of the future where computers just outsmart humans at every turn and you can't beat them um that was one reason why we didn't never really cared about because of the way that marketed Watson as it turns out Watson doesn't have like they haven't been able to actually showcase all that value that's kind of like IBM's different track record right in general now they you can you can create models to do specific tasks it's just really hard to scale that out across you know millions of people and they they were able to like generate Revenue you know Enterprise Revenue constantly with it's really more services than product Revenue what changed was the Transformer model architecture that was released in a paper by researchers from Google in 2017 that outlined a path to um really like increasingly powerful text generation models and language prediction models that um that got the open AI team really interested in like turning those into kind of Open Source models that was the our first taste like Chris and I's first taste of x is on these textual and when it came out it could just auto complete and so I would just like sit in front of my computer write out some like sci-fi product story thing and then just get it to generate ideas for me and I was just clicking it like is that kind of like the Gmail like where you start typing something you know like say hey did you mean to like say this basically yes so Gmail like they they are intentionally very conservative and they're gonna you know just kind of auto complete that sentence but what was great about this was it's so open-ended it could just go off in rails and that was this creative aspect that was way underappreciated now the problem with gpt2 is like it was the first Model that could kind of make sense but it could only make sense like 10 percent the other 90 is like a word jumble and you're like I'm trying to understand what's going on but I don't really understand it and that little taste that 10 taste was enough of a value for me to want to continue to use the product but then there was like a one in a hundred result that was a total Gem and you're like this is this is better than any person could ever imagine like I've never even like it's just so mind-blowing to me I was like this is mind expanding and it's creative yep and that's so once I saw that and once you know Chris saw that we were like hey what what's this going to look like in 10 years from now like if we're on some kind of trend line of improvement in these core models what will this look like continue fast forward six months and they release gpt3 which is a hundred times the size Michael what does it mean 100 times the size of just the processing power just the capabilities like the number of parameters yeah it's a uh well actually I think it's a little more than six months Paul uh talk to Transformer stuff from the time that we yeah from the time that we were using GPT longer than that it might have been a year and a half actually but um that's digressing um basically the model size is a it's like basically how how many parameters is this like model tracking right and there was a big belief when GPT 3 launched that it's like wow this is 175 billion parameter it just means it's like a proxy for the size of the model and it was a hundred times bigger than gpc2 since that period of time we've learned that size actually isn't the end-all be-all and having more data might be but we can go into that a little later so is is Chris kind of the highly technical part of the partnership and Paul you're like the go to market it's a little bit yeah he Chris Chris built out like our whole first version of the app I'm I play it small you're just the Tweeter right you know we chat we chat strategy I've handled like like kind of divide it up a little bit but how did you guys meet and you know initially and then how did you come about like you know open Ai and then how did you decide like this is something worth pursuing great question so we met at a venture fund that we worked at today so we had been working together for the fun we were at helped employees exercise their stock options so for Chris and I we got to invest in hundreds of venture back startup startup and we got to see the entire eco ecos basically every company post all the way you know all the way to IPO and you would end up helping the employee base exercise their options so we get to see every business model you got to see all these great companies you got to figure out where the frontiers of Technology were based on basically and then you got a really good sense of like all right where are things headed you know what's the next big wave of Nation and you had seen like the mobile wave roll through you'd seen satin like like the base software service roll through the crypto kind of wave was rolling through um but we were working together and we were really looking at what how you know how much value could you create in crypto it's not you know it does some things well some things not maybe as well as traditional Technologies and so the value creation part was a little bit of a in our minds but then when we saw gpt3 launch it was very clear that you would have infinite amounts of upside from the creativity of text generation so when you ask the question how what's the value of all potential texts that could be written it's like you know it's an infinite it's literally an infinite amount so where you want to be positioned as a company that turns these text generators into real real world use cases that if we could position your company in front of as much of that Tailwind as possible on the AIS like model Improvement side you know you could build a nice little business so we we started we started testing different product hooks to try to figure out what is the right interface for people to use that makes it easy for them to adopt it figure out how to use it and figure it out how much work needs to be done on top of the open AI models to be able to do what you all do because like to me you know when I first saw open a copy.ai I was like oh is this just an interface on top of gpt3 or is there some sort of Magic on top of GPT that allows people to get the actual outputs that you're you know promising basically like how much work went into adapting the models to meet the kind of you know strategy of the business I can share a bit about that actually so um when we first started it wasn't too much there was some work that could be done there was like you know understanding and following the latest improvements on how to even talk to the AI models like you know you could have just yeah basically there was some initial improvements at that stage uh since then we've invested heavily into r d and turns out we were barely scratching the surface of what's possible and so today you know we work really closely with openai and we're really excited and there's like certain things that we discover that we can still share with them and it's new to them so you know this is a completely Green Field opportunity for discovering what's possible and it's hilarious because it just takes a little bit of creativity I see like a lot of different companies popping up now too and maybe they're just popping up because they're becoming popular but they have their own models like there's um you know there's a dolly basically competitor that's doing some really interesting stuff are there do you see ourselves leveraging a lot of these Partners do you still see yourself you know creating some of your own models like is it what does the future kind of look like yeah yeah so you have you have like base model providers and base models [Music] in some cases you might say okay it's worth our time to invest money into building our own like totally proprietary models um that would you probably like if that happens is like we're not doing that yet maybe down the road but right now you just need to leverage like the latest and greatest and you want to be be best models so it's it's not like like this whole quality cost trade-off like you really need to go after the quality so we we've worked really close with open AI help s and it's been a great kind of Enterprise partnership with them um what's what's nice you know we we're built in a way that's really agnostic so it doesn't you know we can use another provider's models if if that you know that those are better um but they have very different problems that they need to solve and we have very different problems we need to solve this in them so I don't really see a lot of change in the in that framework um you mentioned Dolly that's like an image generation model there is a lot of yeah there are a lot of different image generation models model here right now so it's gonna be interesting to see how that and you know I saw recently the gpt3 at the cost per you know API caller processing has started to come down it seems like to be pretty deflationary is that is that what you expect over the next you know several years is the cost of compute and like the model utilization is just going to keep going down and down and down so the cost of computing will drop like that's a that's a Moore's law issue and but the uh the actual usage amount will compete with each cycle that you see drop and how do you think about that in the framework of like your business model at all I can share a little bit and I actually want to start with a question how many times do you think AWS have dropped their prices I think I've seen something it's in the hundreds or like they do it like every year like you know 50 100 times or something right I mean there's so many people actually since last year it was 107 times since it launched in 2006. like we expect something similar I don't know if it's gonna be that drastic but on our end you know Moore's Law is on the right side here um I was listening to a podcast I think it was the all-in podcast and they were saying that what people haven't realized is that Morris law hasn't ended it just shifted to gpus um and you know so now we are really benefiting from those laws and then the latest research um that has come out I think from Google uh basically stated oh you actually don't need more computation power you just need more data and that means that oh you get really really good models without having to have ridiculous hardware and even one of the dolly competitors according to Twitter was trained for about six hundred thousand dollars which is like insane you've both talked about Vision you know Paul you said it when you first got on Chris I saw you had a LinkedIn post about how important long-term vision is you're you're in a space that's very kind of open-ended you know you focus in right now on copy generation even that is a big opportunity um you know I just saw I don't know if you saw a depth it's like act-1 and basically text prompts can actually you know provide take action in multiple different you know online platforms and do your work for you and stuff like what are the bounds of your vision like where does this go over the next five to ten years what problem do you guys specifically solve versus what the rest of the world of AI is going to solve um it's fascinating right Adept their action Transformer great stuff the speed of this industry is going crazy but you can explain what it what that demo showcase yeah I could do a quick demo of that uh basically they uh from what I understand trained a massive model on a lot of specific data oh no uh specifically for um doing actions on a browser so the demo that they released shows them on Redfin and they type hey give me houses in Houston that are under 600k and I have a family of four and basically Adept new which boxes to click which buttons to click what to type into the boxes to fit your search for this interface and that's like mind-blowing stuff right uh Paul and I like to approach this problem in particular from a where should the world be in 10 years what's not going to change versus yeah I guess it's a working backwards thing uh we definitely got that mental model from Jeff Bezos um but for us it's like okay what is the future you don't want to build and what is the future you do want to build and in Paul in my eye it's like wait we want to make sure the future is human-centric if it's not human-centric it is a scary scary future but then how do you really resolve this conflict that these AI models are getting so good you know like businesses are going to start reducing head count right they're gonna tell us to try their best to reduce as much as possible just from a pure economic standpoint and then the realization was okay well if that's true then it means the corollary is true we need to build the best human tools that allows anybody to be able to launch their own business to be able to accomplish their own goals at a really high rate at an extremely high level and so we have an unofficial vision of a billion new entrepreneurs over the next decade right what would it take what's the platform that needs to get built for that to happen globally and that would be the true entrepreneurial explosion right there needs to be there there are going to be societal shifts there's going to be massive things that will need to change and we want to build the tools that keep it human-centric that keep it so that there is not going to be a huge wealth inequality instead it's going to be almost like the world's greatest like meritocracy in a way where it's like you know the best ideas will come to life they will go more viral they will work and then people will just constantly be able to express their ideas another way of framing this um is you know given a 10 chance of success how many times do you have to try to like start a company before you have like a 90 some percent chance of success across the board I forgot the exact number but it's like high it's like 30 times there's something along those lines um and so it's like okay well then there's two ways of attacking this problem one is to just try more and it's a try more that means you need to be able to increase your velocity of testing right and then the second one is to increase your chances and probability of success per try and if you can do both then you can turn like any idea into some sort of reality that can potentially work as a standalone business you know with as little time and effort as necessary and it's just the true exercise of your creativity right you have an idea it's like wouldn't it be cool if and then it can become reality we can try one of those yeah you try one of those Michael which one Michael how have you ever wanted to own an island have I ever wanted to own one yeah yeah why not seems like a fun thing Richard Branson that's fine how does exactly how does the Earth make Islands I guess it's you know matter coming out from underneath and you know it hardens into rock formations and it keeps pushing itself up volcanoes right okay if you wanted to build your own Island you would need to use volcanoes and pipe lava from a volcano yeah right 100 that's just an engineering problem but somebody's got to own the the land too but yeah I mean if you're in the middle of the ocean you know you just said can you just claim that land offer free grabs yeah yeah damn that's interesting right so that's an idea Elon Musk be like somebody should you know create Islands out of lava like I'm gonna do it you know and then everybody wants to invest in his company's worth a billion dollars the next day right 100 percent and then you have to break you break down the engineering task and you're saying okay well what does it actually take do I need to sell something on the front end to actually find this business can I fundraise like what is it so when musk says okay I'm gonna need tunnels on Mars because we're gonna need an underground you know civilization let's let's test that out you know on Earth and if I'm gonna do it what's the bottleneck to actually doing it really cheaply and that's usually the bottleneck to every kind of kind of real world thing so as it turns out it's just the machine is not very efficient and so his engineering tasks just make a more efficient like tone machine right just look at that problem break it down from first principles and rebuild it from the ground up and get you know a 10x savings um so even that strategy of like how do you actually approach a problem and how do you actually build a solution people are not good at that and so if even if you wanted to do it if you have the wrong approach you're going to spend if you're in like the thing that you want to do and then you end up failing at it so I can't I can't tell you how many Founders are out there they just fail like constantly just constantly you know maybe they fell once maybe they fell twice but it you know if you ask them well what was the how did you approach the problem how did you think about what you would do first and sequence it if that's wrong you're just setting yourself up for failure so so if you're if you're trying to like Empower you know a billion entrepreneurs in the next 10 20 50 years dude and you break it down into first principles does it does it somehow start with copy generation and AI like how did how does it why is that the starting point it's a good plan right what's your plan hey did you think through do you have like your key assumptions laid out are they good assumptions to make right if I'm gonna if I'm let's say we're gonna start this island company where you start first well you might want like a website that explains the project right and you might use like Dolly to generate an image of some some volcano factories in the middle of the ocean yeah you know you know in old days either to find someone to do like concept art but it was like kind of hokey right it was like an illustration but now you can literally generate unlimited shot until you find something that actually really compelling to people is it interesting that the prompt creativity becomes the new kind of creativity you know it's like if the creativity is just shifted it's still text yeah yeah um it is so so now with with the image generation side that's gone so I can just I could show you like 10 renders and you'd be like oh my God like I can the vision you know vision is a very it's a visual thing and how you communicate if I communicate in words you're like Ah that's kind of interesting but what's in your head is not what's in my head and so the purpose of these renders is actually to make it very a lot more concrete for you and a big component that I really did not appreciate especially on the text generation side um was if you have a dumb idea and then you write out a plan it actually makes it not as dumb at all and your the idea had some nugget of something that's interesting enough for you to like think about it and want to express it but when you actually build a plan you can make the idea great so I did this test on Twitter I asked people to reply with like a dumb idea and then I use our tools to like actually create a viable business around like a viable business plan around what they were talking about and then they you'd see it it's like okay the thing that was in my head this creativity got trapped because I could not express it I could not express it to other people and I could not express it to myself and that barrier is this you know I see a lot of uh similarities between adults not being as creative as kids when it comes to like painting artwork um just imagination storytelling like kids are really amazing at that and then at some point you just stop being creative I don't know if it's because school like pounds that out of you because you're penalized for being created numbed by the world right answer are you getting numb exactly you got Numb by the world you got slapped down you know people [Music] like in the workforce if if you have a role and you you go create something new you improve a process you do something that wasn't asked you get rewarded all day long for that and on the like at the most creative like the most creation or creative potential that you have is when you find something you're really passionate about where you can express that creativity and paper productive behind behind this is the point that that Chris mentioned around a billion entrepreneurs like not only are people going to be able to create things easier but they're going to be able to create more things that they want to create and they'll spend less time um doing the stuff that they don't you know they didn't want to do or you didn't know how to do and you'll be able to get those ideas out there much faster and have you have you found that the models help you unlock stuff that's stuck in your brain that you can't articulate you're saying okay I have this really big Vision but I can't really articulate it well here's some of my thoughts around it and AI can help draw that out and amplify it yeah and we have we have a new product feature we're building now that's gonna put that on steroids and what are the bounds of like these types of things if I said hey here's all the parameters of my business where this or that where this swag up does this this is our business model can you provide me things that we should be doing strategies that we should be building out you know you can yeah it'll suggest it can suggest all that stuff for you and does that at a point does that become commoditized because everybody has access to these same models or can you find kind of a differentiation and opportunity yeah the differentiation is like what it's it's where you want to take your product and where you think value can be created so there are many businesses where the model is very standard you end up with multiple companies right and then somebody will Niche down and differentiate over here the better way to frame it is like who has who has the most compelling Vision to unlock the most value and if you do that then each thing you build unlocks more value and that's really the secret of um Road mapping and exploration because this whole area is brand new so so like you said you know you need maybe you want somebody to brainstorm with that has infinite knowledge and infinite wisdom of business models person like it would be you know be a computer that already has you know this train on all this a lot of this information that's probably and do you find that you guys fit that you know that Gap like that's where you want to continue to spend time like I feel like copy you know that's a byproduct that is not like our core like how we make money today but that's actually a byproduct the technology that we're building how do you feel about positioning because you know obviously when you build a business from zero to one you know niching down going after a specific problem people know what you do I mean that's what allows you to get so many customers so quickly but it's also limiting in a way if I copy.ai doesn't fully encapsulate what your vision is and where you're trying to go do you do you find that to be a challenge this is just a natural progression where the company's going to evolve yeah I mean every every company evolves and does more than where they start yeah we have a pretty simple um product heuristic I guess for this which is build really cool stuff demos take care of itself right like you just show what's possible you just show it off in the demo it has to be simple to use easy to understand and then you know people will want to sign up they'll want to sign up and adverse software is set up where they don't need to watch the training they don't need to read documentation and they can use it and get value out of it that's the ultimate um you know filing yeah we've learned a lot from Google their search you know interface is a text box and then search button it's like great right right it's like 80 of their revenue right yeah yeah and that's that's how like they built their platform off of that and it's worked really well for them so I think you know as as our product matures you're gonna see more of that platform effect take hold um across the board there's there's we get a lot of questions about like what's your mode this that I'm like well there are a lot of modes that you build on every time you do something um a great mode is having customers that's an awesome note um having for us like we're really very focused on Distributing the product as widely and as globally as possible that's also re that it reinforces the quality of AI models where the more diverse your training set is both in terms of use case and user like like let's say professionals amateurs like students whatever the more variety you get in your dreams and the benefits of that are mostly occurring to you all or to open AI as well yeah open AI has they have a different piece that they're optimizing for but a lot of this all this training data set that comes to us and we use that to find teams so we we improve on their models for our use cases gotcha from Mike you know you talk about getting into hands as many people as possible do you see kind of a platform orientation for you all in the future where it's very kind of api-centric embedded throughout products across the internet and other people are leveraging your models to you know let's say I'm a book publisher and I want open ai's models like natively in there so entrepreneurs can start book companies like are you going to help them start the book company or is it through apis where you guys are powering those you know experiences that are more niched down to specific you know business models yeah we're we're not we don't have any apis right now apis are they're interesting so we're intrigued but that's not our current business model we have a lot of work to do on the product just the core product first before you get into like real API play yep it makes sense I think yo and it's not it's not right now it's not that easy for like if you're gonna go do an API that's gonna be more of an Enterprise kind of position can a billion people in the world use an API and that take another way of thinking about it that's a great question not maybe you know to me apis are one to many things I mean they're leveraged almost in a B2B sense of like hey I'm going to enable my users to get power from this capability but I'm not going to expose the API to them you know they're just you know leveraging the capabilities of it um but yeah yeah we haven't we have one more assumption which is most pretty much every product will adopt part of the product and we're thinking about it you know how can we automate product mock-ups in real time leveraging Ai and you know image processing based on prompts that people are providing like hey I want to see the copy.a logo you know repeating in a really modern pattern on this box you'll show me that right now you know that I think there's a lot of opportunity just in our business for that but you know that's just one random use case you know and we're paying tens of thousands of dollars a month for design fees for our team you know what happens if the product if the experience becomes instantaneous for the customer and we eliminate that cost it's a it's a win-win for everybody across the board yeah except for the designers yeah or they can become prompt writers or something I don't know I think Chris's point about the abundance of AI is you know could potentially rise the top you know the boats of everybody involved you know if you're an individual designer maybe you can build a massive business on top of these capabilities versus employing a bunch of designers and having a service business or something so I think the abundance and growth ultimately is is really good for people in general for health and the wellness of a country and you know poverty and all these different things especially when you have a declining age of population you know like everybody talks about how you know any crazy even increasing age yeah yeah increasing age but I mean um yeah I mean less babies are being had you know we're going to see a population decline in general but doesn't AI maybe have not if Elon Musk has anything to do with that yeah his family tree is just single-handedly repopulating but don't but don't you feel that AI has the inverse effect of population decline because it also creates just like Leverage for the the lower amount of people that you do have I don't know so productivity and leverage that kind of made sense to me if you think about humans but I hardly disagree on that why is that population is is different population is like the function of the you know people's optimism about the future and if they think there's gonna be more abundance and if they think they can afford the lifestyle they went today so you know AI may maybe will improve the lifestyle people have today but it it's I'm you know it's unclear how but people talk about how population decline you know decreases aggregate demand decreases growth rates but don't you think that AI could have the inverse impact or at least offset some of the you know the lack of productivity and growth and demand a lot of the well the yeah the issue is that if you look at let's just take like the AI stuff we're doing that can improve productivity of like white collar office work but so much of the economies are Services based where you have like teachers and nurses and that is never going to increase their productivity in any meaningful because it's human to Human um work and so when you look at the entire like you break down the entire GDP of economies it's it's not gonna like I know some people on Twitter predicting like 20 GDP you know but we don't even have enough teachers and we don't have standardized education what if AI comes in and teaches at the highest levels you know to the students of the world and drives you know education you know at a much more equal level someone's gotta watch your kids Michael not really I mean people were home you know doing homeschooling while their parents were working in the other room not even paying attention to them so who knows I don't know how much the kids learned I wanted to find out but according to every standardized yeah they're down like 20 30 percent from and according to IQ test scores you're you're having huge drops and that has massive knock-on effects because you can't just like you can't just make that up you can't make up what was lost so I think we definitely need more tooling around that but no uh that that's a disaster so a bit faster we can go on for Forever on that that's like more of a joke Joe Rogan podcast type of conversation um but you know as a user of of your platform especially like when it was first starting it seemed like gamification it was one of the biggest reasons that it kind of took off so quickly because for me I was like [ __ ] I just want to download this and use it because I'm not even downloaded but just use it because it's just fun it's like a game I'm gonna go in I'm gonna type [ __ ] the same thing on Dolly I'm typing stuff I'm sharing it how much was that like helpful in terms of acquiring customers and getting them kind of bought in first and then you know how do you then take that you know light interest and turn it into like hey actual paying customers I know you've done a lot of like free trials like Hey we're free on the weekend like come in you really push on that as a strategy uh weird we have a totally free plan now so every single month and so like that caught that helped like kind of promote the product as well there's a big aha moment when he used generative AI oh I can I can actually expand and know something about what I'm trying that it's an aha moment that's like a mental shift for our users and that's that's like a huge a huge aha moment like one of the best in the business dolly is great too you know you have some idea in your head you type it in there's an image the LinkedIn [ __ ] posting uh generator that was great great just like it's yeah the the [ __ ] that's generator solid stuff right like viral viral post generator um but the problem is you know how how much of how much value can you create off an image for you know how much value you can create off text and then is that a frequent you know repeatable need that you have in your day-to-day um for for some people that are writing a lot yeah that's like a big need and then a lot of other people know it's not so they'll come in and test it out but but maybe that at any given time yeah so it's really our job yeah exactly yeah it's our job to actually increase the value to all users and then long term especially the long tail writing or creating anything on a day-to-day basis Chris Chris are you gonna say something no I just I added yet people are going to be writing a lot more I think people don't write as much because it's just hard to express yourself and when people start learning wow it's actually really easy to express myself if I can just put down raw thoughts and get out it really coherent post that is exactly what I'm trying to say you know that you will share a lot of knowledge it makes it a lot easier to share knowledge it makes it a lot easier to you know share your experience it's just in that unlocks a lot more of the internet the power of the internet for the people that shift to like a paid plan and it's like not like hey I'm just [ __ ] around with this tool because it's fun what are the what are the use cases like what are the major things that they're doing to you know build their business make money you know provide value and impact like what are the most sticky use cases yeah so it's a lot of organic marketing for your business so you know you have you're selling some product online maybe you want Google you know rank higher on Google right so you need to put up a blog posts you need you know content that Google will lift up the rankings so it's like one use case web pages a lot of companies don't even have a web page on their site that explains all their products um so that's that's really easy people use these are tools like our freestyle tool to write emails so all you have to do is just describe like who's this email to what do you need to cover and then you click generate and you get like a completed email out of the end of it that sounds great and you're like oh this is awesome I don't have to spend any time writing that I could just just send it and like it's it's this an amazing enablement thing for human communication like so those are like the the main ones right now we have a lot of um people that do need help like rewriting things maybe like social media posts uh that they need like Instagram captions for if they want like to like build out like a kind of kind of better is it mostly individuals is it teams and companies yeah we have we have a mix of both um because we're freemium we have a lot of individuals um writing is often like a very individual thing that they're doing and then we also have a collaborative functionality as well like we're on a team um like for edit company I think one of the things too with writing is just like it's so hard to get from off the starting block you know like you have that writer's block and and you know in a way you know maybe you don't use the exact prompt but you use it as like a starting point to figure out what should I be thinking about what should I be writing and kind of unblock people and unblock that creativity do you see people kind of leveraging it that way too is like a catalyst uh yes yeah so it it does zero to one writing way better than it does like so you really it is a that's where the the products really shine it makes sense and then what about you know inputting external data sources you know if I'm writing copy for my website or for my ad copy or whatever you know there's external data sources that say disperformed better than than something else is that something that the you know the operator kind of has to just come back and and make tweaks based on what they're seeing or do you do you see foresee kind of bringing in external data to make it more you know powerful and impactful for that user yeah over time we'll see you'll see that yeah for sure makes sense what about you know the next like I also thought Facebook would do that and they have it I thought Google would do that as a feature but they haven't so I don't know what what's taking there's probably like three Google teams working on it and they all don't know that each other's working on it I don't know when it's so we're we're two years out if we over two years out we still have no feature that helps you like but they're probably having a meeting about it probably at Google and then they're gonna meet about it next month to think if they should I don't know it's it's a people yeah people keep asking I'm just I don't know I thought they'd do it I don't know what to tell you it's so core of their business that's literally how they make yeah I'm at a loss I can't they should just pay you guys like 10 million dollars to figure it out for them care about optimizing ads yeah that's that badly sense well you know looking ahead like kind of like the economic environment that we're in as an entrepreneur do you look do you guys look at what's going on externally in the funding environments and the you know Equity markets does it matter at all to your execution on a daily basis if if your employees care about those things or stock valuations and employee stock options is that is that stuff that you kind of have in the back of your mind as you're operating or do you have to kind of just drown out the noise and just you know stay focused dude we thought we were in a tech bubble when we left our jobs and started a company so we thought the good times were going to end almost immediately I think everybody thought that for so long you know it was like a house of cards just waiting to collapse for two three yeah so we've we've kept the team super lean we're we're 26 people we're at 9.1 million in ARR like that's way that's probably it's like almost 500 000 per person in the revenue per employee like it's it's Stout so we've been really disciplined we've burned you know less than one times our ARR since Inception so we care a lot about Capital efficiency and the whole point of AI is that it should make companies more efficient so I'm not sure how companies can bloat up adopt AI like natively it's it's really unfathomable so a lot of the talent that got brought onto teams like a lot of teams across the Venture like startup landscape they were unable to unlock like the 10x value from those Investments and a lot of those folks unfortunately had you know gotten laid off some people now are sensing more layoffs that are like secondly off at their layoff and so it's it's really a crazy time to be so yeah it's something we've thought about a lot um I you know I think the funding Market was probably we'll probably turn around some but you should always operate your business like with some discipline I was gonna say it doesn't seem like it's had to have been like a big shift for you all because you kind of went into it with that mentality already does that come from the time you know observing all those other startups and how they're running them how they're spending money um and also kind of the financial background that you have as well no my uh I lost a lot of money in the first tech bubble when I was in Middle School day trading stocks Middle School nice you're calling your broker at lunch or something you trade so we made all this money like buying all these stocks stock like AOL so you have the scar tissue dude I got layers of it layers of it so that okay why does it account uh got a degree in economics and accounting started my career in accounting then it was like cool I understand if I had to read a financial statement but I don't know what value is so I went into the head industry learn about value investing and growth investing and then I was like cool I understand what increases the value of a company and you know what it is Michael what free cash flow sales sales sales sales is the output of more sales right yes so the question is well how do you grow sales talk to a CPA they have no idea talk to a financial analyst at an investment Bank how do you grow sales they don't know and those are the people that manage and run a lot of companies especially big ones and they have no idea how to grow how do you grow it comes out of the like you need a great product that's adding value and then you Market the [ __ ] out of it it's easier said than done right yeah but you actually have to learn how to do it and you got to try it and um uh no amount of book reading can get you there well no amount of marketing too can can Market you know [ __ ] product to scale no I just disagree with that there are a lot of shitty products that have been marketed well are they marketed well or do they just have like distribution and lock-in that's valuable too right if you're building it that's pretty valuable too like Microsoft teams being like five to ten times bigger than stock is it's definitely not the better product that's a whole separate yeah the better product is the one that's available that is actually no I don't know um can you just continue this with Paul I got it right all good what we have we have jobs Michael we all got jobs we all got jobs last question for you if if you're if you were talking to another startup founder that came up to you and said hey you know Paul and Chris you know I made a lot of bad decisions I over hired you know we spent too much money we're running out you know I don't know if my customers love the product whatever it might be and now they're facing like excellent existential threat yeah what would be your you know words of wisdom for them about to navigate the next you know few weeks and months and and get to the end of the year they have money left or what kind of situation they have they have like one one month of one to two months of Runway but they have a business that generates Revenue [Music] um a month left that's not much you're gonna have to like at least like you're gonna have to let your team go and give them I mean there's a lot of companies in that position right now they just you know they don't make it public but there's a lot of these types of comments clock yeah the clock ran out that's that's what we all sign up for there is a death rate to this this stuff yeah like the great thing about startups though is everybody's adaptable like if you have skills that you've worked on and built over time you can apply those skills at another company if you're a Founder you know in it's easier to raise money for your next thing I would encourage everybody to train big don't give up hope on like really big Ideas it's way easier to fundraise for that those big Ideas it's way easier to hire Talent to get um you know customers interested in what you're doing if it's a big and I I think that yeah my my main takeaway is we had Mark Andreessen say it's time to build and then I'm looking out here you know two years later and no one's built like the volcano piping Islands into existence yeah all this free money and all we did was build a bunch of nfts pretty disappointing points on everyone so we can't just sit back and like make fun of other people like literally if you had a better idea you know you got to go pursue that so I'd say keep dreaming big and make it like the more ambitious the Bolder you make it the more sweet awesome well when they're tons of fun thanks
