[01:55] autol blocks. now back to the episode
[01:58] Paul welcome to the show thanks for
[02:00] having me it's a pleasure to have you
[02:02] I've been following copy AI for quite
[02:04] some time you're one of the more
[02:05] well-known gen AI products and obviously
[02:09] have grown tremendously over the past
[02:12] year especially and so excited to dig in
[02:14] and learn more about the story behind
[02:16] the company but to kick off for anybody
[02:18] who doesn't know about copy AI do you
[02:19] mind maybe giving an introduction of
[02:22] yourself and the journey leading up to
[02:23] the company and what the company is sure
[02:26] so I'm Paul founder and CEO copy AI we
[02:28] got started building products back in
[02:30] July of 2020 when open AI launched gpt3
[02:34] into beta access and before that my cup
[02:37] and I were doing venture capital and we
[02:39] were looking for really the next big
[02:41] Tech wave to hit and we had a ton of
[02:44] ideas that we were thinking would be
[02:45] solvable at some point in time and when
[02:48] we saw first demos of gpt2 6 months
[02:50] later gpt3 arrives it's 100 times the
[02:53] size we built 5 MVPs in 90 days and the
[02:57] fifth one was copy Ai and what we're
[02:58] really trying to understand those use
[03:00] cases and that helped us scale as a
[03:02] product L Growth Company past 10 million
[03:04] users now awesome do you mind describing
[03:08] the journey that the product took what
[03:10] was a product initially how did it grow
[03:12] over time where are you at today the
[03:15] fourth MVP we did was called tag
[03:17] lines. and it was a tagline generator so
[03:20] all we did was generate a slogan or a
[03:23] tagline or title piece of title text and
[03:25] it turns out they were using it for all
[03:27] kinds of different content some people
[03:29] are using to write email like email
[03:31] title lines some people were using it
[03:33] for their presentations other people
[03:35] were using it to write blog posts and so
[03:37] one of the insights there was that this
[03:39] is a very horizontal technology best
[03:41] practices in the Venture world is you
[03:43] build verticalized products that go very
[03:45] narrow if you just step back 5 years ago
[03:48] the idea that this stuff is even
[03:49] possible would be no one would believe
[03:51] it and so when you start thinking
[03:53] through the product in your road map you
[03:56] have to be betting on some of these tail
[03:58] WIS so if you the tail on number one was
[04:01] cost per token so the cost to generate
[04:03] something with the models we knew that
[04:04] would fall pretty rapidly that means
[04:06] that you can do these more complex use
[04:08] cases in the future and not have it
[04:11] totally crush your costs and then the
[04:13] second thing was that it would allow you
[04:15] to provide it with more contacts and
[04:17] more inputs into your generations and
[04:19] the reason why that matters is that
[04:21] greatly expands the number of use cases
[04:23] that you can do and it also puts more of
[04:27] the output quality on the input
[04:30] and less on the models one of the big
[04:33] dropbacks for the model is so great
[04:35] because it's compressed the world's
[04:36] Knowledge from the internet into a very
[04:38] tiny package but the problem is with
[04:40] that compression now if it doesn't know
[04:42] the answer it may act confidently like
[04:45] it does we've already moved out of the I
[04:48] called the co-pilot era and I think a
[04:50] lot of companies are just now getting to
[04:52] the co-pilot era but that again doesn't
[04:55] really help you scale a business the
[04:57] reason I love technology is because
[04:58] that's how we press it's how we get more
[05:00] things done that's how we solve problems
[05:03] at a very core level and so without any
[05:05] kind of technological progress we're
[05:07] just going to look at the same problems
[05:09] not getting solved I think it leads to a
[05:11] lot of social dissatisfaction hey man
[05:13] did we have this problem 30 years ago 50
[05:15] years ago like when are we going to
[05:17] solve it right and it's technology is an
[05:18] exciting thing because you can see all
[05:20] the possibilities to build great
[05:22] generative AI native products you need
[05:25] conviction in the thing you're building
[05:27] our job as an innovator in this space is
[05:30] to one understand as deeply as possible
[05:33] the capabilities directly connect that
[05:36] to use cases they're valuable to to
[05:38] businesses and users awesome yeah very
[05:40] insightful what are you specifically
[05:42] working towards at copy AI it's a great
[05:45] question in the old days if you had the
[05:47] most number of employees you want so
[05:50] Walmart had the most number of employees
[05:52] they were the biggest company and most
[05:54] sales all that and the next phase with
[05:56] computers it was more about how many
[05:58] servers do we have have do we have all
[06:00] the servers do we have all the compute
[06:02] because servers are more efficient now
[06:04] than people and Amazon won that Amazon
[06:06] did really well right and then Apple
[06:08] said let's forget servers what about
[06:10] like how many devices are out there in
[06:12] the world collecting data collecting
[06:14] information bridging that communication
[06:16] between the internet and people in this
[06:17] next phase it's really about
[06:19] intelligence itself so if you think
[06:21] about the usage problem usage is hey I
[06:24] need intelligence to help me solve this
[06:26] use case or this problem or make this
[06:28] business decision so I think for
[06:30] companies you're trying to figure out
[06:32] how do we maximize the amount of
[06:33] intelligence that our system is able to
[06:36] take into account to improve itself and
[06:38] I think a lot of companies in certain
[06:40] aspects are going to be caught way
[06:41] flat-footed they've still got a lot of
[06:43] old systems in place totally and so
[06:46] where does copy aai fit into this entire
[06:48] picture this future where companies are
[06:51] Aid driven they have systems that are
[06:53] working and improving over time what are
[06:56] you helping with right now in
[06:58] facilitating that and future State as
[07:01] well the direction you're headed in good
[07:04] question so now all you have to do is
[07:05] describe the workflow that you want and
[07:07] our system will configure that for you
[07:09] as we add more uh capabilities to it the
[07:13] entire platform actually has now a path
[07:16] towards a self-configuration system
[07:19] where where you're not able to connect
[07:21] your data sources into it and then over
[07:24] time the recommendations get better and
[07:26] better even uh in our platform we
[07:28] generate s and prompts are like that
[07:31] last line of configuration needed to
[07:33] actually get you to something that you
[07:34] can deploy at a high trust level so as
[07:37] it turns out this is a solvable problem
[07:40] which I don't think anyone really
[07:43] appreciates enough and so in a world
[07:46] where workflows are now configuring
[07:48] themselves and adding value themselves
[07:52] that's one heck of a platform awesome so
[07:55] as we wrap up I'm curious what does it
[07:57] take for copy AI to win you were one of
[07:59] the first companies to start building a
[08:02] gen AI copyrighting business which has
[08:05] evolved into something much much more
[08:07] you're automating entire workflows now
[08:10] other companies are going to start
[08:12] looking at this as well there's some
[08:14] other folks that are maybe also
[08:16] competing in the space already what does
[08:18] it take for copy AI to win and
[08:20] capitalize on its position as being one
[08:24] of the first Foles one of the first
[08:25] entrance into this space yeah that's
[08:28] another another great question to me
[08:30] it's and number one it's reducing the
[08:32] friction the user friction for adopting
[08:35] these cases that yeah of course that's
[08:38] product and Engineering but that's also
[08:40] marketing and sales there are a ton of
[08:41] companies with amazing products I'll
[08:44] hear about the product see it I'm like
[08:46] this is awesome and they've been around
[08:48] for 10 years and I'm like you didn't
[08:50] solve my problem the past n n and a half
[08:52] years where were you that's a user
[08:54] problem being early the market has given
[08:56] us a good amount of brain awareness
[08:58] product awareness that we can capitalize
[09:01] we've had competitors from day one we'll
[09:02] have competitors forever I don't think
[09:04] about competitors that much everybody
[09:07] sends me all the time I'm like that's
[09:08] great they still haven't solved the
[09:10] problem exactly it's a big problem to
[09:12] solve yeah it's a big problem to solve
[09:14] but like tell somebody solves it I'm not
[09:15] interested in seeing another product
[09:17] that is just doing run-of-the-mill
[09:19] workflows and they bolted on an llm step
[09:22] that's not solved problem it's
[09:24] connecting to an API you are already
[09:26] doing that the prompts are how you
[09:28] translate the model and to get it and
[09:30] trick it into doing something valuable
[09:33] for you and then the way you set these
[09:35] workflows up you trick it into doing
[09:37] something valuable for you so it's very
[09:39] simple I know L it folks Engineers out
[09:42] there technical people that want it to
[09:44] be more complex than it actually is it's
[09:46] not that hard the more people that can
[09:47] use your product the faster you'll grow
[09:50] the more people aware of your product
[09:52] and understand how to use it and get the
[09:54] most value it's a no-brainer solving
[09:56] those product problems is the very core
[09:58] of delivery us user value a lot of the
[10:00] tooling didn't exist when we started
[10:02] there was no llm Ops type tooling
[10:07] machine learning tools built for this so
[10:09] we built most prototype to built most of
[10:11] it in our own backend and so in in doing
[10:14] that you get an 80% solution with a day
[10:17] or two of engineering effort and I think
[10:20] over time that's also going to be a
[10:21] great Tailwind for us there are a lot of
[10:23] great companies they're going very deep
[10:25] into very specific problems that we have
[10:28] and I'm excited about that too I'm like
[10:29] oh man that's going be great once they
[10:31] get to the point where it's incremental
[10:33] like incrementally valuable at our
[10:35] resource costs that's going to be great
[10:38] and so I look at this whole ecosystem
[10:40] I'm like man it's going to be a
[10:41] fantastic ecosystem to be a part of now
[10:44] my favorite partner has been open AI so
[10:47] far the ones that had the had both the
[10:50] clarity of vision the tenacity and The
[10:53] Willpower to try to solve this problem
[10:55] over a very long period of time without
[10:57] allowed it signal that it was possible
[10:59] so that's also crazy that doesn't happen
[11:03] a lot overall I think there's still a
[11:05] lot of opportunity to be extremely
[11:07] ambitious about solving these top core
[11:09] product problems and how people get
[11:11] value out of large language models and
[11:13] how that pairs with existing platforms
[11:16] existing systems existing ways of doing
[11:18] things pretty much everybody we talk to
[11:21] they are not
[11:23] interested most of the time and ripping
[11:26] out old processes and redoing them yeah
[11:28] the the rip and replace that's a very
[11:30] common go market approach which is more
[11:34] time intensive the payoffs can be bigger
[11:36] if it's a big system that they're
[11:37] getting pulled out but right now it's
[11:39] very much incremental like hey we want
[11:41] to do this we want to do this we want to
[11:42] do this and there's a natural flow that
[11:45] happens once you get into that Rhythm as
[11:48] a company and to see that happen it's
[11:51] great because with man every new use
[11:52] case is like a whole new market that's
[11:54] forming on your platform these are
[11:57] things that were never possible before
[11:59] that certainly gets our team excited
[12:01] every day oh man I didn't know that was
[12:03] possible and then it is and you're like
[12:05] cool one more thing to take to market
[12:07] right just to share with people and let
[12:10] let people know what's possible love it
[12:12] so last question for you Paul what's
[12:15] your vision for the future ahead for
[12:17] copy Ai and maybe even more generally
[12:20] for the generative AI
[12:22] space yeah when we used gpd2 it was a
[12:24] major unlock for our own creativity it
[12:27] actually was making up stuff that we had
[12:29] never thought about before and when you
[12:32] Google it Google would show zero search
[12:34] results and so at that point I was like
[12:37] man I am no longer short of ideas I'm
[12:39] short on how to execute those
[12:41] productively in scale hundreds of
[12:43] startup ideas basically the one that
[12:45] unlocks the most of them the most number
[12:47] of those ideas if we get if we get this
[12:49] system to work like a business that
[12:52] builds itself from an idea and is shaped
[12:55] by the founder without needing a lot of
[12:57] resources without needing a lot of
[12:59] capital without massive teams that's
[13:01] going to accelerate Innovation more than
[13:03] anything else we've ever experienced In
[13:05] Our Lifetime and so I think that's the
[13:07] ultimate Vision I think a lot of people
[13:09] share that Vision they might call it
[13:11] like a wish oh I wish that was possible
[13:14] but I think we have a pretty Clear
[13:15] Vision on how to make that actually
[13:17] happen and I think people see the pieces
[13:19] of it like when they use co-pilot
[13:21] products and they ask it to do something
[13:23] and it can do it and they're like cool
[13:25] let me ask the next thing and see if it
[13:27] can do it and so I think for a lot of
[13:29] folks the bottleneck is like how do you
[13:30] put the pieces together in a way that
[13:32] actually makes sense most people they
[13:34] don't know how to put the pieces
[13:36] together to streamline that whole
[13:38] approach and I think that to me that a
[13:41] lot of that's just workflow so what's
[13:44] how do I sequence all these things that
[13:46] I know I need to do and can I if I do
[13:48] that in the right order do do I then
[13:50] unlock some value for a customer and do
[13:53] I know how to reach customers do I how
[13:54] to market the thing I just build and I
[13:57] think most of those will be solved
[13:58] problems to and then what will be really
[14:01] valuable are these variant visions of
[14:04] the future that are better alternatives
[14:07] to the status quo vision of the future
[14:09] think if you turn on the news now man
[14:11] it's not it's not exciting you're not
[14:13] excited about the future when you turn
[14:14] on the news right so clearly that's not
[14:16] the future that you would spend your day
[14:18] assessing over and thinking about like
[14:20] your productive work hours right I think
[14:23] most people would say no that's not it
[14:26] now what we have to avoid is saying
[14:28] that's inevitable that it's always going
[14:29] to be like that that's also dumb that's
[14:31] a stupid way to live life and you're
[14:34] probably going to be depressed if you
[14:36] live that way and not productive so you
[14:38] won't get accomplished anything you
[14:39] won't get anything done no one will want
[14:41] to hang out with you if you have that
[14:44] approach on life however you take the
[14:46] opposite approach which is hey man we
[14:48] got all this awesome tackling what do we
[14:50] going to do that what how do we how
[14:51] should people live their lives what
[14:53] should they be doing during the day how
[14:55] do we make things some of how do we
[14:56] solve some of these problems we have all
[14:58] this incredible information we have all
[15:00] this data what's that look like what do
[15:02] I want to do what do I want my kids to
[15:04] do those are great questions to ask I
[15:06] get great pleasure out of building
[15:09] something side project that's just that
[15:12] makes me smile that that gets my
[15:14] creativity going and it also reinforces
[15:17] that positivity and an idea of all these
[15:20] possibilities I think that future it's
[15:22] going to be we get a lot of people
[15:24] trying to build it and and those people
[15:27] are really optimistic you excited about
[15:29] what's possible awesome Paul where can
[15:32] people find you and where can people
[15:34] learn more about copy AI you can learn
[15:36] more about copy copy awesome well thanks
[15:39] so much for your time
[15:45] Paul

products and obviously have grown tremendously over the past year especially and so excited to dig in and learn more about the story behind the company but to kick off for anybody who doesn't know about copy AI do you mind maybe giving an introduction of yourself and the journey leading up to the company and what the company is sure so I'm Paul founder and CEO copy AI we got started building

quality on the input and less on the models one of the big dropbacks for the model is so great because it's compressed the world's Knowledge from the internet into a very tiny package but the problem is with that compression now if it doesn't know the answer it may act confidently like it does we've already moved out of the I called the co-pilot era and I think a lot of companies are just now getting to the co-pilot era but that again doesn't really help you scale a business the reason I love technology is because that's how we press it's how we get more things done that's how we solve problems at a very core level and so without any kind of technological progress we're just going to look at the same problems not getting solved I think it leads to a lot of social dissatisfaction hey man did we have this problem 30 years ago 50 years ago like when are we going to solve it right and it's technology is an exciting thing because you can see all the possibilities to build great generative AI native products you need conviction in the thing you're building our job as an innovator in this space is to one understand as deeply as possible the capabilities directly connect that to use cases they're valuable to to businesses and users awesome yeah very insightful what are you specifically working towards at copy AI it's a great question in the old days if you had the most number of employees you want so Walmart had the most number of employees they were the biggest company and most sales all that and the next phase with computers it was more about how many servers do we have have do we have all the servers do we have all the compute because servers are more efficient now than people and Amazon won that Amazon did really well right and then Apple said let's forget servers what about like how many devices are out there in the world collecting data collecting information bridging that communication between the internet and people in this next phase it's really about intelligence itself so if you think about the usage problem usage is hey I need intelligence to help me solve this use case or this problem or make this business decision so I think for companies you're trying to figure out how do we maximize the amount of intelligence that our system is able to take into account to improve itself and I think a lot of companies in certain aspects are going to be caught way flat-footed they've still got a lot of old systems in place totally and so where does copy aai fit into this entire picture this future where companies are Aid driven they have systems that are working and improving over time what are you helping with right now in facilitating that and future State as well the direction you're headed in good question so now all you have to do is describe the workflow that you want and our system will configure that for you as we add more uh capabilities to it the entire platform actually has now a path towards a self-configuration system where where you're not able to connect your data sources into it and then over time the recommendations get better and better even uh in our platform we generate s and prompts are like that last line of configuration needed to actually get you to something that you can deploy at a high trust level so as it turns out this is a solvable problem which I don't think anyone really appreciates enough and so in a world where workflows are now configuring themselves and adding value themselves that's one heck of a platform awesome so as we wrap up I'm curious what does it take for copy AI to win you were one of the first companies to start building a gen AI copyrighting business which has evolved into something much much more you're automating entire workflows now other companies are going to start looking at this as well there's some other folks that are maybe also competing in the space already what does it take for copy AI to win and capitalize on its position as being one of the first Foles one of the first entrance into this space yeah that's another another great question to me it's and number one it's reducing the friction the user friction for adopting these cases that yeah of course that's product and Engineering but that's also marketing and sales there are a ton of companies with amazing products I'll hear about the product see it I'm like this is awesome and they've been around for 10 years and I'm like you didn't solve my problem the past n n and a half years where were you that's a user problem being early the market has given us a good amount of brain awareness product awareness that we can capitalize we've had competitors from day one we'll have competitors forever I don't think about competitors that much everybody sends me all the time I'm like that's great they still haven't solved the problem exactly it's a big problem to solve yeah it's a big problem to solve but like tell somebody solves it I'm not interested in seeing another product that is just doing run-of-the-mill workflows and they bolted on an llm step that's not solved problem it's connecting to an API you are already doing that the prompts are how you translate the model and to get it and trick it into doing something valuable for you and then the way you set these workflows up you trick it into doing something valuable for you so it's very simple I know L it folks Engineers out there technical people that want it to be more complex than it actually is it's not that hard the more people that can use your product the faster you'll grow the more people aware of your product and understand how to use it and get the most value it's a no-brainer solving those product problems is the very core of delivery us user value a lot of the tooling didn't exist when we started there was no llm Ops type tooling machine learning tools built for this so we built most prototype to built most of it in our own backend and so in in doing that you get an 80% solution with a day or two of engineering effort and I think over time that's also going to be a great Tailwind for us there are a lot of great companies they're going very deep into very specific problems that we have and I'm excited about that too I'm like oh man that's going be great once they get to the point where it's incremental like incrementally valuable at our resource costs that's going to be great and so I look at this whole ecosystem I'm like man it's going to be a fantastic ecosystem to be a part of now my favorite partner has been open AI so far the ones that had the had both the clarity of vision the tenacity and The Willpower to try to solve this problem over a very long period of time without allowed it signal that it was possible so that's also crazy that doesn't happen a lot overall I think there's still a lot of opportunity to be extremely ambitious about solving these top core product problems and how people get value out of large language models and how that pairs with existing platforms existing systems existing ways of doing things pretty much everybody we talk to they are not interested most of the time and ripping out old processes and redoing them yeah the the rip and replace that's a very common go market approach which is more time intensive the payoffs can be bigger if it's a big system that they're getting pulled out but right now it's very much incremental like hey we want to do this we want to do this we want to do this and there's a natural flow that happens once you get into that Rhythm as a company and to see that happen it's great because with man every new use case is like a whole new market that's forming on your platform these are things that were never possible before that certainly gets our team excited every day oh man I didn't know that was possible and then it is and you're like cool one more thing to take to market right just to share with people and let let people know what's possible love it so last question for you Paul what's your vision for the future ahead for copy Ai and maybe even more generally for the generative AI space yeah when we used gpd2 it was a major unlock for our own creativity it actually was making up stuff that we had never thought about before and when you Google it Google would show zero search results and so at that point I was like man I am no longer short of ideas I'm short on how to execute those productively in scale hundreds of startup ideas basically the one that unlocks the most of them the most number of those ideas if we get if we get this system to work like a business that builds itself from an idea and is shaped by the founder without needing a lot of resources without needing a lot of capital without massive teams that's going to accelerate Innovation more than anything else we've ever experienced In Our Lifetime and so I think that's the ultimate Vision I think a lot of people share that Vision they might call it like a wish oh I wish that was possible but I think we have a pretty Clear Vision on how to make that actually happen and I think people see the pieces of it like when they use co-pilot products and they ask it to do something and it can do it and they're like cool let me ask the next thing and see if it can do it and so I think for a lot of folks the bottleneck is like how do you put the pieces together in a way that actually makes sense most people they don't know how to put the pieces together to streamline that whole approach and I think that to me that a lot of that's just workflow so what's how do I sequence all these things that I know I need to do and can I if I do that in the right order do do I then unlock some value for a customer and do I know how to reach customers do I how to market the thing I just build and I think most of those will be solved problems to and then what will be really valuable are these variant visions of the future that are better alternatives to the status quo vision of the future think if you turn on the news now man it's not it's not exciting you're not excited about the future when you turn on the news right so clearly that's not the future that you would spend your day assessing over and thinking about like your productive work hours right I think most people would say no that's not it now what we have to avoid is saying that's inevitable that it's always going to be like that that's also dumb that's a stupid way to live life and you're probably going to be depressed if you live that way and not productive so you won't get accomplished anything you won't get anything done no one will want to hang out with you if you have that approach on life however you take the opposite approach which is hey man we got all this awesome tackling what do we going to do that what how do we how should people live their lives what should they be doing during the day how do we make things some of how do we solve some of these problems we have all this incredible information we have all this data what's that look like what do I want to do what do I want my kids to do those are great questions to ask I get great pleasure out of building something side project that's just that makes me smile that that gets my creativity going and it also reinforces that positivity and an idea of all these possibilities I think that future it's going to be we get a lot of people trying to build it and and those people are really optimistic you excited about what's possible awesome Paul where can people find you and where can people learn more about copy AI you can learn more about copy copy awesome well thanks so much for your time Paul
